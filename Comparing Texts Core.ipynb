But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.\n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"\n",

Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015.

       "3    Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.\n",

The encounter will provide a crucial opportunity for Clinton and Sanders -- the leading Democratic contenders -- to contrast their personalities, experience and approach to the key issues in the campaign.\\n\\nThough Clinton and Sanders have rarely mentioned each other's names, they are clearly reacting to each other and their rival's potential weaknesses. Sanders took aim at Clinton's Wall Street record and Iraq vote over the weekend; she put him on the defensive on guns and his poor standing with minority voters.\\n\\nUntil now, they have each had good reason for avoiding full contact with the other. Clinton hasn't wanted to elevate Sanders and his surprisingly strong poll numbers, while Sanders has wanted to maintain his untraditional, above-the-fray image.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, that calculus will change. And the distinctions they've subtly staked out on a range of issues are only likely to grow sharper.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the debate in Las Vegas, the two Democrats have been carefully finessing their political positions in relation to each other and their party's wide coalition, offering clues about how they will spar Tuesday night.\\n\\nSanders has been signaling he will try to strike a contrast with Clinton on reining in Wall Street and on her record of support for military interventions overseas. The former secretary of state, meanwhile, is under pressure to prove to progressives who have flocked to Sanders that she genuinely cares about the middle class. She's expected to highlight her differences with her rival on gun control and to demonstrate the broad support she has among minority voters -- a key sector of the Democratic coalition where Sanders is struggling.\\n\\nAs he limbered up for their clash, Sanders threw down the gauntlet on the Iraq War -- a thrust that Clinton has struggled to counter in the past -- hinting that she has hawkish views that are out of step with the majority of Democratic voters.\\n\\nHis campaign issued a statement reminding voters that he, then a member of the House of Representatives, voted against authorizing the Iraq war in late 2002. At the time he argued that the conflict would destabilize the Middle East, kill large numbers of Americans and Iraqi civilians and hamper the war on terror against al Qaeda.\\n\\nThe statement did not once mention Clinton -- but it did not have to. The then-New York senator did vote to authorize the Iraq war, and that vote was one of her greatest vulnerabilities in the 2008 Democratic campaign against Obama, who also opposed the war.\\n\\nThe Sanders statement raised the possibility that Clinton's vote could haunt her for a second presidential campaign.\\n\\n\"Democrats are no more fond of the Iraq war now than they were back then. That could be a problem,\" Peter Beinart, a foreign policy expert and CNN contributor, said Monday. He added that another Democratic candidate, former Virginia senator and Vietnam war veteran Jim Webb, who was also against the war, could double-team with Sanders to cause trouble for Clinton on the issue.\\n\\nSanders has also been staking out territory to Clinton's left on Syria. The former secretary of state recently distanced herself from Obama's much-criticized policy on the vicious civil war by calling for a no-fly zone to be set up to shield refugees.\\n\\nSanders issued a statement earlier this month pointing out that he opposes such an idea, warning that it could \"get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never ending entanglement in that region.\"\\n\\nThe statement appeared to be a clear appeal to Democrats who share Obama's antipathy toward getting the United States entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict and who are wary of Clinton's more activist instincts on foreign policy.\\n\\nSanders is not alone in seeing Clinton's foreign policy record as a vulnerability. Another Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, also picked up on her Syria position Sunday -- saying on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that a no-fly zone was not advisable and warning that the former secretary of state was \"always quick for the military intervention,\" apparently referring to her previous support for military action in nations such as Iraq and Libya.\\n\\nAnother area where Sanders seems more in tune with the progressive Democratic base is on Wall Street, especially since he has raised most of his money from small donors -- unlike the former secretary of state, who has been relying on big budget fund-raising events with rich contributors. Even with his small-donor focus, Sanders is nearly neck-and-neck in the fund-raising race with Clinton.\\n\\nClinton has made strenuous attempts to connect with what her campaign has called \"regular\" Americans, stressing the need to raise up the middle class to feel the benefits of the economic recovery. But Sanders has said that she hasn't done enough, an argument he may expand upon on the debate stage.\\n\\n\"People will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations with the secretary,\" Sanders said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator also will likely draw an implied contrast with Clinton on two other issues -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact the United States and 11 other nations reached this month and the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry oil from Canada's tar sands across the United States.\\n\\nClinton now says she is a 'no' on both issues, but she took months to get there -- despite fervent opposition to both projects from the left flank of the Democratic Party.\\n\\n\"I am glad that she has reached that conclusion,\" said Sanders in Washington last week when asked about Clinton's opposition to a trade agreement she championed repeatedly as secretary of state. \"This is a conclusion that I reached from day one.\"\\n\\nYet Sanders is not alone in curating the battlefield for the Democratic debate. Clinton, while getting in line with progressive Democratic positions on big issues, has also been preparing to strike key contrasts with Sanders.\\n\\nGuns are one policy issue where Sanders is not completely in sync with the Democratic base, so Clinton is likely to exploit it on Tuesday night.\\n\\nShe has been promising a forthright effort to enact new gun control laws after a string of recent mass shootings. It partly seems to be an attempt to focus attention her rival's record on guns, which recently saw him express his openness to reforms that would hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed with their weapons.\\n\\nClinton has also spent the runup to the debate cementing her links to key voting blocs of the Democratic coalition -- especially in sectors of the party where Sanders is weak. She can point to broad appeal in the party, which could be key to eventually blunting the challenge from Sanders after early-voting contests in the less diverse states of Iowa and New Hampshire where he is strong.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Clinton has met representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement and has even criticized Obama for not going far enough in changing immigration laws.\\n\\n\"Hillary has done a lot of work leading up to this debate that has pretty much gone unnoticed,\" Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN on Monday.\\n\\n\"She's rolled out Latinos for Hillary, she has rolled out Women for Hillary, she has met with the leadership of Black Lives Matter, she has checked a lot of boxes walking into this debate,\" she noted. \"I think she is going to display tomorrow night (Tuesday) her vast support among this coalition.\"\\n\\nThe challenge that Sanders faces reaching out to minority voters, who are a vital part of the Democratic Party voting bloc, was underscored by a new CNN poll Monday finding that only 1% of nonwhite voters in the important early voting state of South Carolina favor him.\\n\\nThat is a showing that Sanders must improve on if he is to come from behind and beat Clinton for the nomination.\n",

presidential race Tuesday, the Florida senator leaves a large cache of delegates behind. So what happens to them, and the delegates of other former candidates, at the convention in Cleveland?\\n\\nThe short answer is: It varies from state to state, but the Republican Party leaves enough wiggle room that the delegates of former candidates could end up being a factor in July.\\n\\n\"An unbound delegate is worth their weight in gold,\" Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist, told FoxNews.com. \"It's hard to speculate and there's a lot going on right now.\"\\n\\nRubio, in suspending his campaign after his home-state Florida loss, leaves 169 delegates behind. Ben Carson accrued eight delegates before he dropped out of the race, while Jeb Bush picked up four. Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul each picked up one in Iowa.\\n\\nAnd if either Ted Cruz or John Kasich drop out in the weeks ahead -- and Donald Trump still has not clinched the nomination with the necessary 1,237 delegates -- additional zombie delegates could be in play in Cleveland.\\n\\nAnd they could hold sway.\\n\\nThat's because in most states, delegates become \"unbound\" and are free to support other contenders as soon as their candidate withdraws.\\n\\nThey don't necessarily have to gravitate toward the front-runner at a contested convention, or, in the case of Rubio's delegates, the candidate the Florida senator may ultimately choose to endorse.\\n\\nThey would become essentially free agents, prizes to be wooed by the candidates duking it out in Cleveland.\\n\\nHowever some states bind their delegates to the first ballot no matter what.\\n\\nIn Tennessee, delegates are bound for two rounds of voting, while in Iowa, Texas, Virginia, Montana, Nevada, Puerto Rico and Washington, candidates are bound for at least one round of voting whether or not the candidate has withdrawn.\\n\\nIn South Carolina, delegates are bound to the candidate for the first ballot. However, if the winner is not nominated, they are bound to the candidate who finished second or third in the state.\\n\\nThe various state laws mean that while some of the delegates can already peel off to other candidates, many would have to wait until after a first ballot in order to be able to vote for another candidate still in the race.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether front-runner Trump might be able to reach 1,237 delegates before the convention and avoid this drama. He currently has 661; Ted Cruz has 406; and John Kasich has 142.\\n\\nThose, such as Kasich, who are banking on the prospect of a contested convention, where the delegates of ex-candidates and other factors could be in play, see a blueprint in past races dating back decades.\\n\\nSince 1880, there have been eight contested GOP conventions and in five of those, the eventual winner did not go into the convention with a plurality of delegates.\\n\\nIn the 1976 Republican convention, it was the unbound delegates moving toward President Gerald Ford instead of Ronald Reagan that handed Ford the nomination that year. Ford held a slight lead going into the convention, but was shy of an outright majority.\\n\\nIn part by using the power of the White House, with promises of visits and patronage to woo over delegates, Ford won the nomination on the first ballot, by a slim 60 votes.\n",

       "      <td>6 Natural Herbs To Prevent Mental Disorders Antioxidants are found to play an important part in this regard. Herbs having antioxidant properties cancel the effects of oxidative compounds that are already present in the body. Since our body is incapable of producing antioxidants that can cancel the effects of all the oxidative free radicals, these have to be taken in the form of dietary supplements. Many herbs have been used since ancient times, for the prevention and treatment of almost every disease known to man. They can either be encapsulated or taken in form of herbal teas. The good thing about herbal treatments is that they do not pose any serious threats to one’s health as they have minimal side effects. MULUNGU BARK Mulungu bark is used in Central and South America for calming the nerves, improving the mood and aiding sleep. Mulungu contains erythravine, an active alkaloid which helps in anxiety reduction and protecting brain function. The flavanoids found in Mulungu are one of the best antioxidants and help in having a healthier brain. They are found to inhibit anxiety without any side effects and do not affect basic motor skills. Another effect of Mulungu is the strong physical sensation of well being. It elevates the mood as well. It is known to be helpful with brain diseases like epilepsy, insomnia and anxiety. Studies have shown that all these diseases lead to major brain disorders and other brain degenerative diseases. Mulungu can be taken on its own or with a stimulant like green tea to amplify its effects. It gives mental clarity and improves brain function. MUCUNA PRURIENS Mucuna has been used in ayurvedic medicine since 1500 B.C and is also known as the velvet bean. Mucuna contains L.dopa which is a biochemical precursor to several neurotransmitters. Dopamine happens to be one of these neurotransmitters in addition to adrenaline and noradrenalin, and it supports improved brain function and increased memory. It also regulates the mood and cognition. Mucuna is widely known as an anti aging herb. The antioxidant properties make it anti inflammatory and effective towards the protection of neurons. It protects brain function by keeping a check over cognitive and neural functions. Mucuna’s secret benefit is that it fights redness in brain, which is one of the symptoms of brain degradation. PASSIFLORA INCARNATA (PASSION FLOWER) Passion flower, also called apricot vine, was found in 1956 in Peru. Passion flower is used in herbal medicines to promote calmness and relaxation. It is also found to be very helpful in reducing anxiety. In synergy with other forms of treatment, it is found to be effective in reducing anxiety, irritability, insomnia and agitation. It also helps with psychiatric disorder called adjustment disorder with anxious mood. Passion flower also helps with sleep disorders and seizures. The best way to take passion flower is, as an herbal tea. According to the NYU Langone Medical Center, you should drink one cup of passion flower tea, three times a day. SCUTELLARIA LATERIFLORA (SKULLCAP) A natural tranquilizer, Skullcap is an American perennial herb found from New York to Virginia and southwards to South Carolina, Alabama and Missouri. Skullcap is a very powerful medicinal herb. It is used in treatments of many nervous related disorders like epilepsy, hysteria, insomnia and anxiety. It is also used in the treatment of ADD and a number of other nervous disorders. It is anti inflammatory, antispasmodic, febrifuge, sedative and tonic in nature. It contains volatile oils, tannins and scutellarins that are very helpful in mental disorders. Research suggests it possesses mood enhancing properties and protects brain against damaging effects caused by inflammation. According to HerbsList , Skullcap eases muscle spasms, muscle twitching and may help in ailments that involve involuntary limb movement, such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. PIPER METHYSTICUM KAVA From the roots and stem of the piper methysticum plant, a non-alcoholic beverage is made. This herb is found in the islands of South Pacific. It is being used since the early 90’s as the herbal medicine for stress and anxiety. It contains kava lactones which are responsible for its psychoactive qualities. They work in the brain to produce non narcotic action against anxiety. Kava is beneficial for anxiety and doesn’t affect heart rate or blood pressure. Other disorders where Kava has been found beneficial are migraines, ADHD, psychosis, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome. GINSENG Ginseng, also called Panax ginseng, and is a widely used herbal remedy, all over the world. Its health benefits have been known for over thousands of years. It is used as a tonic to balance, stimulate and relax the nervous system. It brings strength and wisdom. Ginseng is an adaptogen. Adaptogens are known to make us more resilient to mental and physical stress. They reduce the stress hormone cortisol and increase the adrenal gland. Adaptogens can calm you down and boost your energy without over stimulation. It has the same relaxing effect and increased alertness as experiences after green tea. It helps in getting better sleep, increased energy levels and greater personal satisfaction. It is also helpful with the treatment of depression by regulating serotonin, dopamine and noreprinephrine. It works as brain booster and protector. It improves brain function and concentration. It helps with memory issues and protects against age related mental issues. Ginseng also works as an antioxidant and helps in protecting the brain cells against free radical damage. Increasingly large numbers of people are suffering from brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and Dementia . A number of medicines are also available to help with the symptoms, but they are heavy on the pocket and come with many side effects. These herbs have been in use since hundreds of years and do not pose any health threats. Continuous use of these herbs will ensure a healthy brain, strong enough to fight away any disease.

       "      <td>More Reports Of Votes Flipping From Trump To Clinton In Texas ….election Officials Dismiss Concerns… An Ongoing Cbs4 Voter Fraud Investigation Finds People Voting Twice by IWB · October 27, 2016 Tweet Following our story yesterday, there have been more reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Voters in Arlington and Amarillo complained that when they highlighted the box to select Trump/Pence, it switched to Clinton/Kaine. Now numerous other Texans have gone public on social media to report similar problems. However, election officials in Texas are denying that there is a problem. “Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment,” Frank Phillips, Tarrant County’s election administrator, told WFAA . “Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” Are all these examples just voters making mistakes or inaccurately reporting what happened? Or could there be a real problem with electronic voting machines in Texas? \\nhttp://www.infowars.com/more-reports-of-votes-flipping-from-trump-to-clinton-in-texas/ \\nAn ongoing CBS4 VOTER FRAUD investigation Finds People Voting Twice \\nDENVER (CBS4)– An ongoing CBS4 voter fraud investigation has uncovered a dozen cases where Coloradans are suspected of voting twice. Previous CBS4 Investigations revealed ballots cast in the names of Coloradans who had been dead for months– sometimes years- before votes were cast in their names. \\nIn six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle. \\nhttp://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/cbs4-investigation-finds-people-voting-twice/ \\nVoting Machine Caught on Camera Casting Ballot for Democrat when Selecting Republican \\nEarly voting has only been underway for two whole and we’re already facing a glitch in the system. Chambers County was forced to pull the plug on their voting machines and turn to the paper ballot due to a software problem. All electronic voting has been stopped until the software can be updated. \\nhttp://kluv.cbslocal.com/2016/10/26/chambers-county-texas-switches-to-paper-ballots/ \\nFlorida Governor Busted Attempting To Toss Thousands Of Mail-In Ballots \\nA federal judge on Saturday blocked Florida Governor Rick Scott’s attempt to throw out tens of thousands of mail-in ballots, then publicly reprimanded him. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a blistering caution to Scott’s top election official on a lawsuit about vote-by-mail ballots. \\nAccording to ABC News , the judge accused Governor Scott appointed Secretary of State Ken Detzner of “delaying a hearing on the lawsuit, so that he could use every second available to run out the clock,” . That means, there would not be enough time to address the lawsuit. Then, Judge Walker said the governor’s man, Detzner, was in effect committing an “undeclared war’ on Florida voters’ rights. \\nFlorida’s Democratic Party filed a lawsuit asserting that thousands of vote-by-mail ballots were rejected each election, because the voter’s ballot envelope and the registration file signatures do not match. Without a signature, Florida law says that a vote-by-mail ballot cannot be counted.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington’s Intent is Economic Destabilization and “Regime Change” In Venezuela</td>\n",
       "      <td>By Stephen Lendman\\nVenezuela’s oil-dependent economy suffers greatly from low crude oil prices and US economic warfare – waged to destabilize the country, create enormous hardships, mobilize majority opposition to President Nicolas Maduro’s leadership, and end nearly 18 years of economic and social progress. The collapse in the price of crude oil was the result of a carefully designed speculative operation. \\nNeocons in Washington want control over Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, among the world’s largest. With full US support and encouragement, the right wing opposition which controls the National Assembly want Maduros ousted – its latest tactic by recall referendum as constitutionally permitted. \\nOn October 18, Venezuela’s Supreme Court ruled valid signatures of 20% of voters in each of the nation’s 24 states must be collected to proceed with a process against Maduro.\\n“(F)ailure…will render the call for the presidential recall referendum as nullified,” the High Court said in its ruling.\\nOn October 21, Venezuela’s National Electoral Council (CNE) suspended the referendum until further notice, following Supreme Court allegations of fraud. Over 30% of signatures collected had irregularities – including listing over 10,000 deceased persons.\\nA previous article explained how Venezuela’s recall referendum works. Article 72 of Venezuela’s Constitution states “(a)ll magistrates and other offices (including the president) filled by popular vote are subject to revocation.”\\n“Once half (their) term of office…has elapsed, 20% of (registered) voters (by petition may call for) a referendum to revoke such official’s mandate.”\\n“When a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favor of revocation (provided the total is 20% or more of registered voters), the official’s mandate shall be deemed revoked…”\\nSignatures collected must be verified for authenticity before proceeding further with the recall process. If achieved, it’ll be organized within 90 days. Removing Maduro requires support from more than the 50.6% of voters supporting his 2013 election.\\nTiming is important. If held by January 10, 2017, a new election will be called if Maduro loses. If things go against him after this date, Vice President Aristobulo Isturiz will serve as president until January 2019, when his term expires.\\nIn response to CNE’s suspending the recall process, the factions controlling the National Assembly barely stopped short of urging coup d’etat action to remove Maduro forcefully.\\nLast Sunday, they said they’ll impeach him for “violating democracy.” The body has no legal standing after ignoring the Supreme Court’s October 18 ruling.\\nUnited Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) leader Hector Rodriguez mocked them, saying parties violating the “rules of the game come and talk about democracy…There will be no recall referendum in 2016 because of fraudulent signatures collected.”\\nViolent demonstrations may follow, similar to what occurred in 2014 – perhaps another US coup attempt.\\nOn October 24, WaPo editors disgracefully headlined “How to derail Venezuela’s new dictatorship.” What followed was a disgraceful litany of misinformation, exaggeration and Big Lies.\\nWaPo: Maduro “made clear (he and his government are) prepared to shred what remained of the country’s constitutional order…(They) stripped the opposition-controlled national assembly of its powers, imprisoned several top leaders and tried to slow” the recall process.\\nFact: Maduro and Venezuela’s CNE observe the letter of constitutional law. No opposition powers were “stripped.” Their imprisoned officials plotted to remove Maduro by coup d’etat.\\nCollecting fraudulent signatures “slow(ed)” the recall process, not administration officials.\\nWaPo: Opposition National Assembly members “issued a declaration saying Mr. Maduro had staged a coup. That is accurate – and it ought to provoke a consequential reaction from the United States and Venezuela’s Latin American neighbors.”\\nFact: No Maduro “coup” occurred, nor is one in prospect. WaPo calling for “consequential” action sounds ominously like urging Washington to oust him forcefully.\\nWaPo: “The recall referendum the opposition was pursuing offered a democratic way out of what has become one of the worst political and humanitarian crises in Latin America’s modern history.”\\nFact: US dirty tricks and economic manipulation leading to disruptions in the distribution of food, bear much responsibility for hard times in Venezuela. Real problems exist. Hunger isn’t one of them. WaPo lied claiming “(t)he vast majority of low-income families say they are having trouble obtaining food.”\\nVenezuelans changed their dietary practices because of the scarcity of commonly eaten foods, at times consuming less than earlier. Profiteers hoarding and diverting foodstuffs for resale are responsible, along with high inflation resulting economic manipulation.\\nWaPo: “(T)he United States should be coordinating tough international action.”\\nFact: Neocon WaPo editors want Maduro toppled and replaced. Do they mean by coup d’etat by calling for “tough international action?”\\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at lendmanstephen@sbcglobal.net .

       "      <td>Contaminated Food from China Now Entering the U.S. Under the 'Organic' Label The Chinese food production industry is one of the world's least-regulated and most corrupt, as ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/contaminated-food-from-china-now.html The Chinese food production industry is one of the world's least-regulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked \"organic.\"Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don't trust them. What's more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk.U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products \"organic,\" though they are far from it.There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it's not smart to trust what is put on packaging.In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese \"organic\" food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. 'Dirty water' is all there is The report noted further:\"This is reality – all of China's grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.\"Many Chinese farmers won't even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That's because it's clear that China's water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country's entire food supply.Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except \"dirty water.\" As part of the country's industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported.The site noted further that as China's industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country's water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year.In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China's water, say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black – yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well. These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: Fish: Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China, as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. Chicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu.Apples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. Rice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. Mushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. Salt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. Black pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. Green peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. Garlic: About one-third of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China.Shop wisely.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Satanic Nature of Modern Cult-ure Under the guise of \"secularism,\" society has been inducted into a satanic cult, Cabalism. ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-satanic-nature-of-modern-cult-ure.html Under the guise of \"secularism,\" society has been inducted into a satanic cult, Cabalism. The goal is to deny man's soul connection to the Divine and reduce him to a domestic animal. \"The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music...\"There should be a POISON symbol over the doors of our universities, theatres and art galleries. A similar warning should appear on our TV programs, music and videos.In the 1920's, the Comintern decided that the West could be conquered by first subverting its cultural institutions--family, education, religion, art, mass media and government.They have largely succeeded. While maintaining their familiar format, they have subtly changed the content. It's like lacing a bottle of aspirin with arsenic. We are noticing that our political and cultural leaders are mostly cowards, dupes, traitors, crooks, opportunists and impostors.Our failure to combat Communism is due to misunderstanding its real nature. Communism is a facade for a satanic cult ( Cabalism , Freemasonry ) empowered by Masonic Jewish international bankers. It is designed to absorb the world's wealth, and eventually to reduce and enslave the human race. The 5-pointed Red Star of Communism is also the symbol of Satanism .A demonic virus, Communism has morphed into countless forms, hoodwinking more people than ever.Western Civilization is built on Christianity, the premise that God is real, indeed the Ultimate Reality, spiritual in character. Through man's Divine soul, an individual can discern the God's Will without mediation from a worldly authority. This is why the bankers hate Christianity.God is the Truth, Love, Beauty and Goodness to which we all aspire. An immanent Moral Order precludes a small clique monopolizing the world's wealth and enslaving its population. So, the bankers must destroy our belief in God by promoting Darwinism, Existentialism etc. They create war, depression and terror so we will accept their New World Order . THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL In his brilliant essay, \" The Frankfurt School and Political Correctness \" Michael Minnichino reveals that most of the fashionable intellectual and artistic movements in the 20th century, still in vogue today, were actually inspired by thinkers who were Comintern (Communist International) agents financed by the central bankers. Some of them actually worked for Soviet Intelligence (NKVD) right into the 1960's.He writes: \"The task [of the Frankfurt School] was first to undermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an \"abolition of culture\" ...and second, to determine new cultural forms which would increase the alienation of the population, thus creating a \"new barbarism.\" \"... The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music... \"Funds came from \"various German and American universities, the Rockefeller Foundation , the American Jewish Committee, several American intelligence services...\"This subversive movement \"represents almost the entire theoretical basis of all the politically correct aesthetic trends which now plague our universities.\" They are associated with Post Modernism, Feminism, Cultural Studies, Deconstructionism, Semiotics, etc.Their net effect is to divorce us from truth, social cohesion and our cultural heritage. They assert that reality is unknowable and that writers and artists are just depicting their own subjective reality. For example, postmodernist Hayden White writes, \"historical narratives are verbal fictions, the contents of which are more invented than found...truth and reality are primarily authoritarian weapons of our times.\" In other words, we cannot know what happened in the past (which is exactly what they want.)Postmodernism is part of the authoritarian agenda. Similarly the Frankfurt School championed the notion that \"authoritarianism\" is caused by religion, male leadership, marriage and family, when these things actually uphold society.As far as the humanities are concerned, universities are enemy territory and professors usually are obstacles to genuine learning. THE ANCIENT CONSPIRACY Communism manifests an ancient Luciferian Jewish revolt against God and man. The Jewish Pharisees rejected Christ because he taught that God is Love and all men are equal in the sight of God.\"The advent of Christ was a national catastrophe for the Jewish people, especially for the leaders,\" Leon de Poncins writes. \"Until then they alone had been the Sons of the Covenant; they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries....\"He continues: \"The irreducible antagonism with which Judaism has opposed Christianity for 2000 years is the key and mainspring of modern subversion... [The Jew] championed reason against the mythical world of the spirit ...he was the doctor of unbelief; all those who were mentally in revolt came to him either secretly or in broad daylight...\" (Judaism and the Vatican, pp.111-113.)In addition to Jewish Cabalism, Freemasonry has been the bankers' tool. It was instrumental in the destruction of the Christian monarchies in Germany, Austria and Russia and the decline of the Catholic Church. This is also the view revealed in The Red Symphony .In his Encyclical Humanum Genus (1884) Pope Leo XIII wrote that the ultimate aim of Freemasonry is \"to uproot completely the whole religious and moral order of the world, which has been brought into existence by Christianity... This will mean that the foundation and the laws of the new structure of society will be drawn from pure naturalism.\"Again Pope Leo XIII said: \"Freemasonry is the permanent personification of the Revolution; it constitutes a sort of society in reverse whose aim is to exercise an occult overlordship upon society as we know it, and whose sole raison d'etre consists of waging war against God and his Church.\" (De Poncins, Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 45)De Poncins cites an article that appeared in 1861 in a Parisian Jewish Review La Verite Israelite: \"But the spirit of Freemasonry is that of Judaism in its most fundamental beliefs; its ideas are Judaic, its language is Judaic, its very organization, almost, is Judaic... \"De Poncins writes that the goal of both Freemasonry and Judaism is the unification of the world under Jewish law. ( Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 76) CONCLUSION Just as we need healthy food and exercise, our mind and soul needs to be nourished by truth and beauty. We need to see life portrayed honestly, with the real forces identified. Instead, we are deliberately deceived and degraded by a small financial elite with a diabolical plan. White stallions (our souls) are fed a diet of sawdust.Whether it's school or mass media, we are bombarded with propaganda designed to produce alienation and dysfunction. We must protect ourselves from this poison before it is too late.The good news is that modern culture has been exposed as a long-term Illuminati psy-op designed to demoralize us. It will fail.

       "      <td>Dear Friends, in the article below The Saker explains how Vladimir Putin wrest the sovereignty of Russia away from the Anglo-Zionist Empire. He hopes that Donald Trump can rescue America. His article is republished with his permission. \\nCan Trump Save America Like Putin Saved Russia? \\nThe Saker \\nOctober 22, 2016 \\nA crisis faces America: \\nOption one: Hillary wins. That’s Obama on steroids, only worse. Remember that Obama himself was Dubya, only worse. Of course, Dubya was just Clinton, only worse. Now the circle is closed. Back to Clinton. Except this time around, we have a woman who is deeply insecure, who failed at every single thing that she every tried to do, and who now has a 3 decades long record of disasters and failures. Even when she had no authority to start a war, she started one (told Bill to bomb the Serbs). Now she might have that authority. And she had to stand there, in front of millions of people, and hear Trump tell her “Putin outsmarted you at every step of the way.” Did you see her frozen face when he said that? Trump is right, Putin did outsmart her and Obama at every step. The problem is that now, after having a President with an inferiority complex towards Putin (Obama) we will have a President with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a no-fly zone over Russian forces in Syria. Looking at Hillary, with her ugly short hair and ridiculous pants, I thought to myself “this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough and any man” – except of course that she ain’t. Her record also shows her as being weak, cowardly and with a sense of total impunity. And now, that evil messianic lunatic (http://thesaker.is/the-messianic-lunatic-in-her-own-words/) with a deep-seated inferiority complex might become Commander in Chief?! God help us all! \\nOption two: Trump wins. Problem: he will be completely alone. The Neocons have a total, repeat total, control of the Congress, the media, banking and finance, and the courts. From Clinton to Clinton they have deeply infiltrated the Pentagon, Foggy Bottom, and the three letter agencies. The Fed is their stronghold. How in the world will Trump deal with these rabid “ crazies in the basement”? http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_donald_a_080423_leo_strauss_and_the_.htm \\nConsider the vicious hate campaign which all these “personalities” (from actors, to politicians to reporters) have unleashed against Trump – they have burned their bridges, they know that they will lose it all if Trump wins (and, if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference anyway). The Neocons have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one. What could Trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by Neocons and their agents of influence? Bring in an entirely different team? How is he going to vet them? His first choice was to take Pence as a VP – a disaster (he is already sabotaging Trump on Syria and the elections outcome). I *dread* to hear whom Trump will appoint as a White House Chief of Staff as I am afraid that just to appease the Neocons he will appoint some new version of the infamous Rahm Emanuel… And should Trump prove that he has both principles and courage, the Neocons can always “Dallas” him and replace him with Pence. Et voilà! \\nI see only one way out: \\nHow Putin Rescued Russia When Putin came to power he inherited a Kremlin every bit as corrupt and traitor-infested as the White House nowadays. As for Russia, she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the Independent Nazi-run Ukraine. Russia was also run by bankers and AngloZionist puppets and most Russians led miserable lives. The big difference is that, unlike what is happening with Trump, the Russian version of the US Neocons never saw the danger coming from Putin. He was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate money, Medvedev. This was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the Russian society which were still functioning, the security services and oil/gas money. Putin looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting suit, a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the the Seven Bankers running Russia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina ). Except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in Russia history. Here is what Putin did as soon as he came to power: \\nFirst, he re-established the credibility of the Kremlin with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the Wahabi insurgency in Chechnia. This established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs. \\nSecond, he used the fact that everybody, every single businessman and corporation in Russia, did more or less break the law during the 1990s, if only because there really was no law. Instead of cracking down on the likes of Berezovski or Khodorkovski for their political activities, he crushed them with (absolutely true) charges of corruption. Crucially, he did that very publicly, sending a clear message to the other arch-enemy: the media. \\nThird, contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and Russian liberals, Putin never directly suppressed any dissent, or cracked down on the media or, even less so, ordered the murder of anybody. He did something much smarter. Remember that modern journalists are first and foremost presstitutes, right? By mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs Putin deprived the presstitutes of their source of income and political support. Some emigrated to the Ukraine, others simply resigned, and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as Dozhd TV, Ekho Moskvy Radio or the newspaper Kommersant. Those who emigrated became irrelevant, as for those who stayed in the “liberal zoo” – they were harmless as they had no credibility left. Crucially, everybody else “got the message”. After that, all it took is the appointment a few real patriots (such as Dmitri Kiselev, Margarita Simonian and others) in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned. \\nFourth, once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the “liberal” (in the Russian sense, meaning pro-USA) parties to enter into a death-spiral from which they have never recovered. That, in turn, resulted in the ejection of all “liberals” from the Duma which now has only 4 parties, all of them more or less “patriotic”. That’s the part of Putin’s strategy that worked. \\nSo far, Putin has failed to eject the 5th columnists, whom I call the “Atlantic Integrationists” (see http://thesaker.is/putins-biggest-failure/ ) from the government itself. What is certain is that Putin has not tackled the 5th columnists in the banking/finance sector and that the latter are being very careful not to give him a pretext to take action against them. \\nRussia and the USA are very different countries, and no recipe can be simply copied from one to another. Still, there are valuable lessons from the “Putin model” for Trump, not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the Fed and in the banks that control the Fed. What is sure is that for the time being the image of the USA will continue to be that of homeless veterans abandoned by the US government wrapping themselves in the American flag and asking for coins in a cup. \\nHillary thinks that Ameria’s wars are a stunning success. Trump thinks that they are a disgrace. I submit that the choice between these two is really very simple. \\nTo those who are saying that there cannot be a schism in the AngloZionist elites, I reply that the example of the conspiracy to prevent Dominique Strauss-Kahn from becoming the next French president ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Strauss-Kahn ) shows that, just like hyenas, AngloZionist leaders do sometimes turn on each other. That happens in all regimes, regardless of their political ideology (think SS against SA in Nazi Germany or Trotskists against Stalinists in Boshevik USSR). \\nAn Iron Broom Leon Trotsky used to say the Soviet Russia needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an “iron broom”. He even wrote an article in the Pravda entitled “We need an iron broom”. Another genocidal manic, Felix Derzhinskii, founder of the notorious ChK secret police, used to say that a secret police officer must have a “burning heart, a cool head and clean hands”. One would seek weakness, or even compassion, in vain from folks like these. These are ideology-driven “true believers”, sociopaths with no sense of empathy, profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way. \\nHillary Clinton and her gang of Neocons are the spiritual (and sometimes even physical) successors of the Soviet Bolsheviks and they, just like their Bolshevik forefathers, will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies. Donald Trump – assuming he is for real and actually means what he says – has to understand that and do what Putin did: strike first and strike hard. \\nStalin, by the way, also did exactly that, and the Trotskyists were crushed. \\nI think that the jury is still out on whether Putin will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power. What is sure is that Russia is at least semi-free from the control of the Anglo-Zionists and that the US is their last bastion right now. Their maniacal hatred of Trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger these folks feel, being threatened for the first time in what they see as their homeland (I don’t mean that in a patriotic sense – but rather like a parasite’s care for “his” host). And maybe they have some good reason to fear. I sure hope that they do. \\nI am rather encouraged by the way Trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear. Yesterday Trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize the outcome. And even though every semi-literate person knows that elections in the USA have been rigged and stolen in the past, including Presidential ones, by saying that Trump committed a major case of crimethink. The Ziomedia pounced on him with self-righteous outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement. Instead of rolling over and recanting his “crime”, Trump replied that he will respect the election results if he wins. \\nBeautiful no? Let’s hope he continues to show the same courage. \\nTrump is doing now what Jean-Marie Le Pen did in France: he is showing the Neocons that be that he dares to openly defy them, that he refuses to play by their rules, that their outrage has no effect on him and that they don’t get to censor or, even less so, silence him. That is also what he did when, yet again, he refused to accuse the Russians of cyber-attacks and, instead, repeated that it would be a good thing for Russia and the USA to be friends. Again, I am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that line, but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the AngloZionist deep state and Empire. \\nConclusion: The United States are about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of their history. If Trump is elected, he will have to immediately launch a well-planned attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions. In Russia, Putin could count on the support of the military and the security services. I don’t know whom Trump can count on, but I am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the US armed forces. If Trump gets the right person to head the FBI, he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for corruption, conspiracy to (fill the blank), abuse of authority, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty, etc. Since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of power, they are also easy to prove, and cracking down on corruption would get Trump a standing ovation from the American people. Next, just as Putin did in Russia, Trump will have to deal with the media. How exactly, I don’t know. But he will have to face this beast and defeat it. At every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the people, just like Putin does. \\nCan Trump do it? I don’t know. I would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore the power of the people is even harder in the USA than it was in Russia. I have always believed that the AngloZionist Empire will have to be brought down from the outside, most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats. I still believe that. However, I might be wrong – in fact, I hope that I am – and maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Empire in order to save the United States. If there is such a possibility, however slim, I think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse.

field empty if you want to post as Anonymous. It's preferable that you choose a name so it becomes clear who said what. E-mail address is not mandatory either. The website automatically checks for spam. Please refer to our moderation policies for more details. We check to make sure that no comment is mistakenly marked as spam. This takes time and effort, so please be patient until your comment appears. Thanks. (2) 10 replies to a comment are the maximum. (3) Here are formating examples which you can use in your writing:<b>bold text</b> results in bold text <i>italic text</i> results in italic text (You can also combine two formating tags with each other, for example to get bold-italic text.)<em>emphasized text</em> results in emphasized text <strong>strong text</strong> results in strong text <q>a quote text</q> results in a quote text (quotation marks are added automatically) <cite>a phrase or a block of text that needs to be cited</cite> results in: a phrase or a block of text that needs to be cited <blockquote>a heavier version of quoting a block of text...</blockquote> results in: a heavier version of quoting a block of text that can span several lines. Use these possibilities appropriately. They are meant to help you create and follow the discussions in a better way. They can assist in grasping the content value of a comment more quickly. and last but not least:<a href=''http://link-address.com''>Name of your link</a> results in Name of your link (4) No need to use this special character in between paragraphs:  ; You do not need it anymore. Just write as you like and your paragraphs will be separated. The \"Live Preview\" appears automatically when you start typing below the text area and it will show you how your comment will look like before you send it.

Dismiss Concerns… An Ongoing Cbs4 Voter Fraud Investigation Finds People Voting Twice by IWB · October 27, 2016 Tweet Following our story yesterday, there have been more reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Voters in Arlington and Amarillo complained that when they highlighted the box to select Trump/Pence, it switched to Clinton/Kaine. Now numerous other Texans have gone public on social media to report similar problems. However, election officials in Texas are denying that there is a problem. “Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment,” Frank Phillips, Tarrant County’s election administrator, told WFAA . “Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” Are all these examples just voters making mistakes or inaccurately reporting what happened? Or could there be a real problem with electronic voting machines in Texas? \\nhttp://www.infowars.com/more-reports-of-votes-flipping-from-trump-to-clinton-in-texas/ \\nAn ongoing CBS4 VOTER FRAUD investigation Finds People Voting Twice \\nDENVER (CBS4)– An ongoing CBS4 voter fraud investigation has uncovered a dozen cases where Coloradans are suspected of voting twice. Previous CBS4 Investigations revealed ballots cast in the names of Coloradans who had been dead for months– sometimes years- before votes were cast in their names. \\nIn six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle. \\nhttp://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/cbs4-investigation-finds-people-voting-twice/ \\nVoting Machine Caught on Camera Casting Ballot for Democrat when Selecting Republican \\nEarly voting has only been underway for two whole and we’re already facing a glitch in the system.

U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a blistering caution to Scott’s top election official on a lawsuit about vote-by-mail ballots. \\nAccording to ABC News , the judge accused Governor Scott appointed Secretary of State Ken Detzner of “delaying a hearing on the lawsuit, so that he could use every second available to run out the clock,” . That means, there would not be enough time to address the lawsuit. Then, Judge Walker said the governor’s man, Detzner, was in effect committing an “undeclared war’ on Florida voters’ rights. \\nFlorida’s Democratic Party filed a lawsuit asserting that thousands of vote-by-mail ballots were rejected each election, because the voter’s ballot envelope and the registration file signatures do not match. Without a signature, Florida law says that a vote-by-mail ballot cannot be counted.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            By Stephen Lendman\\nVenezuela’s oil-dependent economy suffers greatly from low crude oil prices and US economic warfare – waged to destabilize the country, create enormous hardships, mobilize majority opposition to President Nicolas Maduro’s leadership, and end nearly 18 years of economic and social progress. The collapse in the price of crude oil was the result of a carefully designed speculative operation. \\nNeocons in Washington want control over Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, among the world’s largest. With full US support and encouragement, the right wing opposition which controls the National Assembly want Maduros ousted – its latest tactic by recall referendum as constitutionally permitted. \\nOn October 18, Venezuela’s Supreme Court ruled valid signatures of 20% of voters in each of the nation’s 24 states must be collected to proceed with a process against Maduro.\\n“(F)ailure…will render the call for the presidential recall referendum as nullified,” the High Court said in its ruling.\\nOn October 21, Venezuela’s National Electoral Council (CNE) suspended the referendum until further notice, following Supreme Court allegations of fraud. Over 30% of signatures collected had irregularities – including listing over 10,000 deceased persons.\\nA previous article explained how Venezuela’s recall referendum works. Article 72 of Venezuela’s Constitution states “(a)ll magistrates and other offices (including the president) filled by popular vote are subject to revocation.”\\n“Once half (their) term of office…has elapsed, 20% of (registered) voters (by petition may call for) a referendum to revoke such official’s mandate.”\\n“When a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favor of revocation (provided the total is 20% or more of registered voters), the official’s mandate shall be deemed revoked…”\\nSignatures collected must be verified for authenticity before proceeding further with the recall process. If achieved, it’ll be organized within 90 days. Removing Maduro requires support from more than the 50.6% of voters supporting his 2013 election.\\nTiming is important. If held by January 10, 2017, a new election will be called if Maduro loses. If things go against him after this date, Vice President Aristobulo Isturiz will serve as president until January 2019, when his term expires.\\nIn response to CNE’s suspending the recall process, the factions controlling the National Assembly barely stopped short of urging coup d’etat action to remove Maduro forcefully.\\nLast Sunday, they said they’ll impeach him for “violating democracy.” The body has no legal standing after ignoring the Supreme Court’s October 18 ruling.\\nUnited Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) leader Hector Rodriguez mocked them, saying parties violating the “rules of the game come and talk about democracy…There will be no recall referendum in 2016 because of fraudulent signatures collected.”\\nViolent demonstrations may follow, similar to what occurred in 2014 – perhaps another US coup attempt.\\nOn October 24, WaPo editors disgracefully headlined “How to derail Venezuela’s new dictatorship.” What followed was a disgraceful litany of misinformation, exaggeration and Big Lies.\\nWaPo: Maduro “made clear (he and his government are) prepared to shred what remained of the country’s constitutional order…(They) stripped the opposition-controlled national assembly of its powers, imprisoned several top leaders and tried to slow” the recall process.\\nFact: Maduro and Venezuela’s CNE observe the letter of constitutional law. No opposition powers were “stripped.” Their imprisoned officials plotted to remove Maduro by coup d’etat.\\nCollecting fraudulent signatures “slow(ed)” the recall process, not administration officials.\\nWaPo: Opposition National Assembly members “issued a declaration saying Mr. Maduro had staged a coup. That is accurate – and it ought to provoke a consequential reaction from the United States and Venezuela’s Latin American neighbors.”\\nFact: No Maduro “coup” occurred, nor is one in prospect. WaPo calling for “consequential” action sounds ominously like urging Washington to oust him forcefully.\\nWaPo: “The recall referendum the opposition was pursuing offered a democratic way out of what has become one of the worst political and humanitarian crises in Latin America’s modern history.”\\nFact: US dirty tricks and economic manipulation leading to disruptions in the distribution of food, bear much responsibility for hard times in Venezuela. Real problems exist. Hunger isn’t one of them. WaPo lied claiming “(t)he vast majority of low-income families say they are having trouble obtaining food.”\\nVenezuelans changed their dietary practices because of the scarcity of commonly eaten foods, at times consuming less than earlier. Profiteers hoarding and diverting foodstuffs for resale are responsible, along with high inflation resulting economic manipulation.\\nWaPo: “(T)he United States should be coordinating tough international action.”\\nFact: Neocon WaPo editors want Maduro toppled and replaced. Do they mean by coup d’etat by calling for “tough international action?”\\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at lendmanstephen@sbcglobal.net .

\\n@Crookedfootball over on Twitter says, “Look how the Sun has darkened Gina Miller’s skin compared to the Times” \\nThe Sun: \\nThe Times: \\nObviously this could be just web bollocks but @Ajjolley has checked the paper versions next to each other: \\n“Printed in same plant”, he says, “Little doubt the Sun darkened photo of Gina Miller” \\nHowever @CaeruleanSea says, “as much as I loathe the Sun, the Times have upped the exposure on their pic. Google pics from that speech.” \\nAnd yep – he has a point: look at the BBC coverage Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37861888 \\nIn conclusion: the media has sent us all entirely mad that we’re now checking how dark people are in Photoshop.   \n",

Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked \"organic.\"Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don't trust them. What's more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk.U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products \"organic,\" though they are far from it.There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it's not smart to trust what is put on packaging.In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese \"organic\" food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. 'Dirty water' is all there is The report noted further:\"This is reality – all of China's grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.\"Many Chinese farmers won't even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That's because it's clear that China's water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country's entire food supply.Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except \"dirty water.\" As part of the country's industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported.The site noted further that as China's industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country's water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year.In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China's water, say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black – yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well. These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: Fish: Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China, as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. Chicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu.Apples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. Rice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. Mushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. Salt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. Black pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. Green peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. Garlic: About one-third of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China.Shop wisely.   \n",

Today on TRUNEWS, Rick Wiles raises the alarm about Germany’s biggest bank bracing for a potentially catastrophic earnings report Thursday, and NATO redeploying forces to Russia’s doorstep. Rick also speaks with Jeremy Wiles, the CEO of KingdomWorks Studios, about his harrowing new film “ ”, which details the apathy German Christians displayed toward the Holocaust during World War 2, and the warning American evangelicals MUST heed everyday while the lives of the unborn are slaughtered domestically. \\nToday’s Audio Streamcast.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-satanic-nature-of-modern-cult-ure.html Under the guise of \"secularism,\" society has been inducted into a satanic cult, Cabalism. The goal is to deny man's soul connection to the Divine and reduce him to a domestic animal. \"The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music...\"There should be a POISON symbol over the doors of our universities, theatres and art galleries. A similar warning should appear on our TV programs, music and videos.In the 1920's, the Comintern decided that the West could be conquered by first subverting its cultural institutions--family, education, religion, art, mass media and government.They have largely succeeded. While maintaining their familiar format, they have subtly changed the content. It's like lacing a bottle of aspirin with arsenic. We are noticing that our political and cultural leaders are mostly cowards, dupes, traitors, crooks, opportunists and impostors.Our failure to combat Communism is due to misunderstanding its real nature. Communism is a facade for a satanic cult ( Cabalism , Freemasonry ) empowered by Masonic Jewish international bankers. It is designed to absorb the world's wealth, and eventually to reduce and enslave the human race. The 5-pointed Red Star of Communism is also the symbol of Satanism .A demonic virus, Communism has morphed into countless forms, hoodwinking more people than ever.Western Civilization is built on Christianity, the premise that God is real, indeed the Ultimate Reality, spiritual in character. Through man's Divine soul, an individual can discern the God's Will without mediation from a worldly authority. This is why the bankers hate Christianity.God is the Truth, Love, Beauty and Goodness to which we all aspire. An immanent Moral Order precludes a small clique monopolizing the world's wealth and enslaving its population. So, the bankers must destroy our belief in God by promoting Darwinism, Existentialism etc. They create war, depression and terror so we will accept their New World Order . THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL In his brilliant essay, \" The Frankfurt School and Political Correctness \" Michael Minnichino reveals that most of the fashionable intellectual and artistic movements in the 20th century, still in vogue today, were actually inspired by thinkers who were Comintern (Communist International) agents financed by the central bankers. Some of them actually worked for Soviet Intelligence (NKVD) right into the 1960's.He writes: \"The task [of the Frankfurt School] was first to undermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an \"abolition of culture\" ...and second, to determine new cultural forms which would increase the alienation of the population, thus creating a \"new barbarism.\" \"... The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music... \"Funds came from \"various German and American universities, the Rockefeller Foundation , the American Jewish Committee, several American intelligence services...\"This subversive movement \"represents almost the entire theoretical basis of all the politically correct aesthetic trends which now plague our universities.\" They are associated with Post Modernism, Feminism, Cultural Studies, Deconstructionism, Semiotics, etc.Their net effect is to divorce us from truth, social cohesion and our cultural heritage. They assert that reality is unknowable and that writers and artists are just depicting their own subjective reality. For example, postmodernist Hayden White writes, \"historical narratives are verbal fictions, the contents of which are more invented than found...truth and reality are primarily authoritarian weapons of our times.\" In other words, we cannot know what happened in the past (which is exactly what they want.)Postmodernism is part of the authoritarian agenda. Similarly the Frankfurt School championed the notion that \"authoritarianism\" is caused by religion, male leadership, marriage and family, when these things actually uphold society.As far as the humanities are concerned, universities are enemy territory and professors usually are obstacles to genuine learning. THE ANCIENT CONSPIRACY Communism manifests an ancient Luciferian Jewish revolt against God and man. The Jewish Pharisees rejected Christ because he taught that God is Love and all men are equal in the sight of God.\"The advent of Christ was a national catastrophe for the Jewish people, especially for the leaders,\" Leon de Poncins writes. \"Until then they alone had been the Sons of the Covenant; they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries....\"He continues: \"The irreducible antagonism with which Judaism has opposed Christianity for 2000 years is the key and mainspring of modern subversion... [The Jew] championed reason against the mythical world of the spirit ...he was the doctor of unbelief; all those who were mentally in revolt came to him either secretly or in broad daylight...\" (Judaism and the Vatican, pp.111-113.)In addition to Jewish Cabalism, Freemasonry has been the bankers' tool. It was instrumental in the destruction of the Christian monarchies in Germany, Austria and Russia and the decline of the Catholic Church. This is also the view revealed in The Red Symphony .In his Encyclical Humanum Genus (1884) Pope Leo XIII wrote that the ultimate aim of Freemasonry is \"to uproot completely the whole religious and moral order of the world, which has been brought into existence by Christianity... This will mean that the foundation and the laws of the new structure of society will be drawn from pure naturalism.\"Again Pope Leo XIII said: \"Freemasonry is the permanent personification of the Revolution; it constitutes a sort of society in reverse whose aim is to exercise an occult overlordship upon society as we know it, and whose sole raison d'etre consists of waging war against God and his Church.\" (De Poncins, Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 45)De Poncins cites an article that appeared in 1861 in a Parisian Jewish Review La Verite Israelite: \"But the spirit of Freemasonry is that of Judaism in its most fundamental beliefs; its ideas are Judaic, its language is Judaic, its very organization, almost, is Judaic... \"De Poncins writes that the goal of both Freemasonry and Judaism is the unification of the world under Jewish law. ( Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 76) CONCLUSION Just as we need healthy food and exercise, our mind and soul needs to be nourished by truth and beauty. We need to see life portrayed honestly, with the real forces identified. Instead, we are deliberately deceived and degraded by a small financial elite with a diabolical plan. White stallions (our souls) are fed a diet of sawdust.Whether it's school or mass media, we are bombarded with propaganda designed to produce alienation and dysfunction. We must protect ourselves from this poison before it is too late.The good news is that modern culture has been exposed as a long-term Illuminati psy-op designed to demoralize us. It will fail.

       "6280  Dear Friends, in the article below The Saker explains how Vladimir Putin wrest the sovereignty of Russia away from the Anglo-Zionist Empire. He hopes that Donald Trump can rescue America. His article is republished with his permission. \\nCan Trump Save America Like Putin Saved Russia? \\nThe Saker \\nOctober 22, 2016 \\nA crisis faces America: \\nOption one: Hillary wins. That’s Obama on steroids, only worse. Remember that Obama himself was Dubya, only worse. Of course, Dubya was just Clinton, only worse. Now the circle is closed. Back to Clinton. Except this time around, we have a woman who is deeply insecure, who failed at every single thing that she every tried to do, and who now has a 3 decades long record of disasters and failures. Even when she had no authority to start a war, she started one (told Bill to bomb the Serbs). Now she might have that authority. And she had to stand there, in front of millions of people, and hear Trump tell her “Putin outsmarted you at every step of the way.” Did you see her frozen face when he said that? Trump is right, Putin did outsmart her and Obama at every step. The problem is that now, after having a President with an inferiority complex towards Putin (Obama) we will have a President with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a no-fly zone over Russian forces in Syria. Looking at Hillary, with her ugly short hair and ridiculous pants, I thought to myself “this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough and any man” – except of course that she ain’t. Her record also shows her as being weak, cowardly and with a sense of total impunity. And now, that evil messianic lunatic (http://thesaker.is/the-messianic-lunatic-in-her-own-words/) with a deep-seated inferiority complex might become Commander in Chief?! God help us all! \\nOption two: Trump wins. Problem: he will be completely alone. The Neocons have a total, repeat total, control of the Congress, the media, banking and finance, and the courts. From Clinton to Clinton they have deeply infiltrated the Pentagon, Foggy Bottom, and the three letter agencies. The Fed is their stronghold. How in the world will Trump deal with these rabid “ crazies in the basement”? http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_donald_a_080423_leo_strauss_and_the_.htm \\nConsider the vicious hate campaign which all these “personalities” (from actors, to politicians to reporters) have unleashed against Trump – they have burned their bridges, they know that they will lose it all if Trump wins (and, if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference anyway). The Neocons have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one. What could Trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by Neocons and their agents of influence? Bring in an entirely different team? How is he going to vet them? His first choice was to take Pence as a VP – a disaster (he is already sabotaging Trump on Syria and the elections outcome). I *dread* to hear whom Trump will appoint as a White House Chief of Staff as I am afraid that just to appease the Neocons he will appoint some new version of the infamous Rahm Emanuel… And should Trump prove that he has both principles and courage, the Neocons can always “Dallas” him and replace him with Pence. Et voilà! \\nI see only one way out: \\nHow Putin Rescued Russia When Putin came to power he inherited a Kremlin every bit as corrupt and traitor-infested as the White House nowadays. As for Russia, she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the Independent Nazi-run Ukraine. Russia was also run by bankers and AngloZionist puppets and most Russians led miserable lives. The big difference is that, unlike what is happening with Trump, the Russian version of the US Neocons never saw the danger coming from Putin. He was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate money, Medvedev. This was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the Russian society which were still functioning, the security services and oil/gas money. Putin looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting suit, a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the the Seven Bankers running Russia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina ). Except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in Russia history. Here is what Putin did as soon as he came to power: \\nFirst, he re-established the credibility of the Kremlin with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the Wahabi insurgency in Chechnia. This established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs. \\nSecond, he used the fact that everybody, every single businessman and corporation in Russia, did more or less break the law during the 1990s, if only because there really was no law. Instead of cracking down on the likes of Berezovski or Khodorkovski for their political activities, he crushed them with (absolutely true) charges of corruption. Crucially, he did that very publicly, sending a clear message to the other arch-enemy: the media. \\nThird, contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and Russian liberals, Putin never directly suppressed any dissent, or cracked down on the media or, even less so, ordered the murder of anybody. He did something much smarter. Remember that modern journalists are first and foremost presstitutes, right? By mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs Putin deprived the presstitutes of their source of income and political support. Some emigrated to the Ukraine, others simply resigned, and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as Dozhd TV, Ekho Moskvy Radio or the newspaper Kommersant. Those who emigrated became irrelevant, as for those who stayed in the “liberal zoo” – they were harmless as they had no credibility left. Crucially, everybody else “got the message”. After that, all it took is the appointment a few real patriots (such as Dmitri Kiselev, Margarita Simonian and others) in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned. \\nFourth, once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the “liberal” (in the Russian sense, meaning pro-USA) parties to enter into a death-spiral from which they have never recovered. That, in turn, resulted in the ejection of all “liberals” from the Duma which now has only 4 parties, all of them more or less “patriotic”. That’s the part of Putin’s strategy that worked. \\nSo far, Putin has failed to eject the 5th columnists, whom I call the “Atlantic Integrationists” (see http://thesaker.is/putins-biggest-failure/ ) from the government itself. What is certain is that Putin has not tackled the 5th columnists in the banking/finance sector and that the latter are being very careful not to give him a pretext to take action against them. \\nRussia and the USA are very different countries, and no recipe can be simply copied from one to another. Still, there are valuable lessons from the “Putin model” for Trump, not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the Fed and in the banks that control the Fed. What is sure is that for the time being the image of the USA will continue to be that of homeless veterans abandoned by the US government wrapping themselves in the American flag and asking for coins in a cup. \\nHillary thinks that Ameria’s wars are a stunning success. Trump thinks that they are a disgrace. I submit that the choice between these two is really very simple. \\nTo those who are saying that there cannot be a schism in the AngloZionist elites, I reply that the example of the conspiracy to prevent Dominique Strauss-Kahn from becoming the next French president ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Strauss-Kahn ) shows that, just like hyenas, AngloZionist leaders do sometimes turn on each other. That happens in all regimes, regardless of their political ideology (think SS against SA in Nazi Germany or Trotskists against Stalinists in Boshevik USSR). \\nAn Iron Broom Leon Trotsky used to say the Soviet Russia needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an “iron broom”. He even wrote an article in the Pravda entitled “We need an iron broom”. Another genocidal manic, Felix Derzhinskii, founder of the notorious ChK secret police, used to say that a secret police officer must have a “burning heart, a cool head and clean hands”. One would seek weakness, or even compassion, in vain from folks like these. These are ideology-driven “true believers”, sociopaths with no sense of empathy, profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way. \\nHillary Clinton and her gang of Neocons are the spiritual (and sometimes even physical) successors of the Soviet Bolsheviks and they, just like their Bolshevik forefathers, will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies. Donald Trump – assuming he is for real and actually means what he says – has to understand that and do what Putin did: strike first and strike hard. \\nStalin, by the way, also did exactly that, and the Trotskyists were crushed. \\nI think that the jury is still out on whether Putin will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power. What is sure is that Russia is at least semi-free from the control of the Anglo-Zionists and that the US is their last bastion right now. Their maniacal hatred of Trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger these folks feel, being threatened for the first time in what they see as their homeland (I don’t mean that in a patriotic sense – but rather like a parasite’s care for “his” host). And maybe they have some good reason to fear. I sure hope that they do. \\nI am rather encouraged by the way Trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear. Yesterday Trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize the outcome. And even though every semi-literate person knows that elections in the USA have been rigged and stolen in the past, including Presidential ones, by saying that Trump committed a major case of crimethink. The Ziomedia pounced on him with self-righteous outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement. Instead of rolling over and recanting his “crime”, Trump replied that he will respect the election results if he wins. \\nBeautiful no? Let’s hope he continues to show the same courage. \\nTrump is doing now what Jean-Marie Le Pen did in France: he is showing the Neocons that be that he dares to openly defy them, that he refuses to play by their rules, that their outrage has no effect on him and that they don’t get to censor or, even less so, silence him. That is also what he did when, yet again, he refused to accuse the Russians of cyber-attacks and, instead, repeated that it would be a good thing for Russia and the USA to be friends. Again, I am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that line, but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the AngloZionist deep state and Empire. \\nConclusion: The United States are about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of their history. If Trump is elected, he will have to immediately launch a well-planned attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions. In Russia, Putin could count on the support of the military and the security services. I don’t know whom Trump can count on, but I am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the US armed forces. If Trump gets the right person to head the FBI, he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for corruption, conspiracy to (fill the blank), abuse of authority, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty, etc. Since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of power, they are also easy to prove, and cracking down on corruption would get Trump a standing ovation from the American people. Next, just as Putin did in Russia, Trump will have to deal with the media. How exactly, I don’t know. But he will have to face this beast and defeat it. At every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the people, just like Putin does. \\nCan Trump do it? I don’t know. I would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore the power of the people is even harder in the USA than it was in Russia. I have always believed that the AngloZionist Empire will have to be brought down from the outside, most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats. I still believe that. However, I might be wrong – in fact, I hope that I am – and maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Empire in order to save the United States. If there is such a possibility, however slim, I think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse.

    42   Shoina is a village drowned up to the waist in sand. Its denizens are quite fatalistic about it, and their only means of protection is leaving their door open for the night, as they can never be sure if they can open it in the morning. The village of Shoina is situated beyond the Arctic Circle, 1,400 kilometers north of Moscow. This tiny settlement is known for its sands, which appeared here over 50 years ago and have been waging a relentless offensive against humans ever since, depriving them of living space. How did they appear, and where else in Russia can you find unusual places like this? Solve the mystery, on RTDoc.

       "      <td>Donald Trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday during a day-long tour of Washington, casting doubt on the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular U.S. military presence in Asia.\\n\\nThe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of The Washington Post — came on a day when Trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to Republican elites.\\n\\nOn Monday night, Trump delivered a scripted address in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by Israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the Palestinians.\\n\\nTrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the Republican Party’s nomination. But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In Baltimore's call for federal police probe, a new search for answers (+video)</td>\n",
       "      <td>While some Justice Department investigations are adversarial, a new model of collaborative reform is surprising police in some cities, as they find themselves included as part of the solution.\\n\\nSearching for a \"framework ... [to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I’ve Insulted Deserved It By Andrew Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” \\nDonald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

       "      <td>Inside the Trump-Bush melodrama: Decades of tension and discomfort</td>\n",
       "      <td>Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Watch the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. ET live on CNN and CNNgo ; join the conversation at #DemDebate\\n\\nWashington (CNN) The shadow boxing that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have played at for months -- they've barely mentioned each other on the campaign trail -- will give way to more direct jabs Tuesday night.\\n\\nThat's when the two rivals line up on stage at the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign, sponsored by CNN and Facebook. The encounter will provide a crucial opportunity for Clinton and Sanders -- the leading Democratic contenders -- to contrast their personalities, experience and approach to the key issues in the campaign.\\n\\nThough Clinton and Sanders have rarely mentioned each other's names, they are clearly reacting to each other and their rival's potential weaknesses. Sanders took aim at Clinton's Wall Street record and Iraq vote over the weekend; she put him on the defensive on guns and his poor standing with minority voters.\\n\\nUntil now, they have each had good reason for avoiding full contact with the other. Clinton hasn't wanted to elevate Sanders and his surprisingly strong poll numbers, while Sanders has wanted to maintain his untraditional, above-the-fray image.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, that calculus will change. And the distinctions they've subtly staked out on a range of issues are only likely to grow sharper.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the debate in Las Vegas, the two Democrats have been carefully finessing their political positions in relation to each other and their party's wide coalition, offering clues about how they will spar Tuesday night.\\n\\nSanders has been signaling he will try to strike a contrast with Clinton on reining in Wall Street and on her record of support for military interventions overseas. The former secretary of state, meanwhile, is under pressure to prove to progressives who have flocked to Sanders that she genuinely cares about the middle class. She's expected to highlight her differences with her rival on gun control and to demonstrate the broad support she has among minority voters -- a key sector of the Democratic coalition where Sanders is struggling.\\n\\nAs he limbered up for their clash, Sanders threw down the gauntlet on the Iraq War -- a thrust that Clinton has struggled to counter in the past -- hinting that she has hawkish views that are out of step with the majority of Democratic voters.\\n\\nHis campaign issued a statement reminding voters that he, then a member of the House of Representatives, voted against authorizing the Iraq war in late 2002. At the time he argued that the conflict would destabilize the Middle East, kill large numbers of Americans and Iraqi civilians and hamper the war on terror against al Qaeda.\\n\\nThe statement did not once mention Clinton -- but it did not have to. The then-New York senator did vote to authorize the Iraq war, and that vote was one of her greatest vulnerabilities in the 2008 Democratic campaign against Obama, who also opposed the war.\\n\\nThe Sanders statement raised the possibility that Clinton's vote could haunt her for a second presidential campaign.\\n\\n\"Democrats are no more fond of the Iraq war now than they were back then. That could be a problem,\" Peter Beinart, a foreign policy expert and CNN contributor, said Monday. He added that another Democratic candidate, former Virginia senator and Vietnam war veteran Jim Webb, who was also against the war, could double-team with Sanders to cause trouble for Clinton on the issue.\\n\\nSanders has also been staking out territory to Clinton's left on Syria. The former secretary of state recently distanced herself from Obama's much-criticized policy on the vicious civil war by calling for a no-fly zone to be set up to shield refugees.\\n\\nSanders issued a statement earlier this month pointing out that he opposes such an idea, warning that it could \"get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never ending entanglement in that region.\"\\n\\nThe statement appeared to be a clear appeal to Democrats who share Obama's antipathy toward getting the United States entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict and who are wary of Clinton's more activist instincts on foreign policy.\\n\\nSanders is not alone in seeing Clinton's foreign policy record as a vulnerability. Another Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, also picked up on her Syria position Sunday -- saying on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that a no-fly zone was not advisable and warning that the former secretary of state was \"always quick for the military intervention,\" apparently referring to her previous support for military action in nations such as Iraq and Libya.\\n\\nAnother area where Sanders seems more in tune with the progressive Democratic base is on Wall Street, especially since he has raised most of his money from small donors -- unlike the former secretary of state, who has been relying on big budget fund-raising events with rich contributors. Even with his small-donor focus, Sanders is nearly neck-and-neck in the fund-raising race with Clinton.\\n\\nClinton has made strenuous attempts to connect with what her campaign has called \"regular\" Americans, stressing the need to raise up the middle class to feel the benefits of the economic recovery. But Sanders has said that she hasn't done enough, an argument he may expand upon on the debate stage.\\n\\n\"People will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations with the secretary,\" Sanders said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator also will likely draw an implied contrast with Clinton on two other issues -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact the United States and 11 other nations reached this month and the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry oil from Canada's tar sands across the United States.\\n\\nClinton now says she is a 'no' on both issues, but she took months to get there -- despite fervent opposition to both projects from the left flank of the Democratic Party.\\n\\n\"I am glad that she has reached that conclusion,\" said Sanders in Washington last week when asked about Clinton's opposition to a trade agreement she championed repeatedly as secretary of state. \"This is a conclusion that I reached from day one.\"\\n\\nYet Sanders is not alone in curating the battlefield for the Democratic debate. Clinton, while getting in line with progressive Democratic positions on big issues, has also been preparing to strike key contrasts with Sanders.\\n\\nGuns are one policy issue where Sanders is not completely in sync with the Democratic base, so Clinton is likely to exploit it on Tuesday night.\\n\\nShe has been promising a forthright effort to enact new gun control laws after a string of recent mass shootings. It partly seems to be an attempt to focus attention her rival's record on guns, which recently saw him express his openness to reforms that would hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed with their weapons.\\n\\nClinton has also spent the runup to the debate cementing her links to key voting blocs of the Democratic coalition -- especially in sectors of the party where Sanders is weak. She can point to broad appeal in the party, which could be key to eventually blunting the challenge from Sanders after early-voting contests in the less diverse states of Iowa and New Hampshire where he is strong.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Clinton has met representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement and has even criticized Obama for not going far enough in changing immigration laws.\\n\\n\"Hillary has done a lot of work leading up to this debate that has pretty much gone unnoticed,\" Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN on Monday.\\n\\n\"She's rolled out Latinos for Hillary, she has rolled out Women for Hillary, she has met with the leadership of Black Lives Matter, she has checked a lot of boxes walking into this debate,\" she noted. \"I think she is going to display tomorrow night (Tuesday) her vast support among this coalition.\"\\n\\nThe challenge that Sanders faces reaching out to minority voters, who are a vital part of the Democratic Party voting bloc, was underscored by a new CNN poll Monday finding that only 1% of nonwhite voters in the important early voting state of South Carolina favor him.\\n\\nThat is a showing that Sanders must improve on if he is to come from behind and beat Clinton for the nomination.</td>\n",

       "      <td>With Marco Rubio dropping out of the Republican presidential race Tuesday, the Florida senator leaves a large cache of delegates behind. So what happens to them, and the delegates of other former candidates, at the convention in Cleveland?\\n\\nThe short answer is: It varies from state to state, but the Republican Party leaves enough wiggle room that the delegates of former candidates could end up being a factor in July.\\n\\n\"An unbound delegate is worth their weight in gold,\" Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist, told FoxNews.com. \"It's hard to speculate and there's a lot going on right now.\"\\n\\nRubio, in suspending his campaign after his home-state Florida loss, leaves 169 delegates behind. Ben Carson accrued eight delegates before he dropped out of the race, while Jeb Bush picked up four. Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul each picked up one in Iowa.\\n\\nAnd if either Ted Cruz or John Kasich drop out in the weeks ahead -- and Donald Trump still has not clinched the nomination with the necessary 1,237 delegates -- additional zombie delegates could be in play in Cleveland.\\n\\nAnd they could hold sway.\\n\\nThat's because in most states, delegates become \"unbound\" and are free to support other contenders as soon as their candidate withdraws.\\n\\nThey don't necessarily have to gravitate toward the front-runner at a contested convention, or, in the case of Rubio's delegates, the candidate the Florida senator may ultimately choose to endorse.\\n\\nThey would become essentially free agents, prizes to be wooed by the candidates duking it out in Cleveland.\\n\\nHowever some states bind their delegates to the first ballot no matter what.\\n\\nIn Tennessee, delegates are bound for two rounds of voting, while in Iowa, Texas, Virginia, Montana, Nevada, Puerto Rico and Washington, candidates are bound for at least one round of voting whether or not the candidate has withdrawn.\\n\\nIn South Carolina, delegates are bound to the candidate for the first ballot. However, if the winner is not nominated, they are bound to the candidate who finished second or third in the state.\\n\\nThe various state laws mean that while some of the delegates can already peel off to other candidates, many would have to wait until after a first ballot in order to be able to vote for another candidate still in the race.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether front-runner Trump might be able to reach 1,237 delegates before the convention and avoid this drama. He currently has 661; Ted Cruz has 406; and John Kasich has 142.\\n\\nThose, such as Kasich, who are banking on the prospect of a contested convention, where the delegates of ex-candidates and other factors could be in play, see a blueprint in past races dating back decades.\\n\\nSince 1880, there have been eight contested GOP conventions and in five of those, the eventual winner did not go into the convention with a plurality of delegates.\\n\\nIn the 1976 Republican convention, it was the unbound delegates moving toward President Gerald Ford instead of Ronald Reagan that handed Ford the nomination that year. Ford held a slight lead going into the convention, but was shy of an outright majority.\\n\\nIn part by using the power of the White House, with promises of visits and patronage to woo over delegates, Ford won the nomination on the first ballot, by a slim 60 votes.</td>\n",

But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.   \n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015.

       "3  Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.   \n",

The encounter will provide a crucial opportunity for Clinton and Sanders -- the leading Democratic contenders -- to contrast their personalities, experience and approach to the key issues in the campaign.\\n\\nThough Clinton and Sanders have rarely mentioned each other's names, they are clearly reacting to each other and their rival's potential weaknesses. Sanders took aim at Clinton's Wall Street record and Iraq vote over the weekend; she put him on the defensive on guns and his poor standing with minority voters.\\n\\nUntil now, they have each had good reason for avoiding full contact with the other. Clinton hasn't wanted to elevate Sanders and his surprisingly strong poll numbers, while Sanders has wanted to maintain his untraditional, above-the-fray image.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, that calculus will change. And the distinctions they've subtly staked out on a range of issues are only likely to grow sharper.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the debate in Las Vegas, the two Democrats have been carefully finessing their political positions in relation to each other and their party's wide coalition, offering clues about how they will spar Tuesday night.\\n\\nSanders has been signaling he will try to strike a contrast with Clinton on reining in Wall Street and on her record of support for military interventions overseas. The former secretary of state, meanwhile, is under pressure to prove to progressives who have flocked to Sanders that she genuinely cares about the middle class. She's expected to highlight her differences with her rival on gun control and to demonstrate the broad support she has among minority voters -- a key sector of the Democratic coalition where Sanders is struggling.\\n\\nAs he limbered up for their clash, Sanders threw down the gauntlet on the Iraq War -- a thrust that Clinton has struggled to counter in the past -- hinting that she has hawkish views that are out of step with the majority of Democratic voters.\\n\\nHis campaign issued a statement reminding voters that he, then a member of the House of Representatives, voted against authorizing the Iraq war in late 2002. At the time he argued that the conflict would destabilize the Middle East, kill large numbers of Americans and Iraqi civilians and hamper the war on terror against al Qaeda.\\n\\nThe statement did not once mention Clinton -- but it did not have to. The then-New York senator did vote to authorize the Iraq war, and that vote was one of her greatest vulnerabilities in the 2008 Democratic campaign against Obama, who also opposed the war.\\n\\nThe Sanders statement raised the possibility that Clinton's vote could haunt her for a second presidential campaign.\\n\\n\"Democrats are no more fond of the Iraq war now than they were back then. That could be a problem,\" Peter Beinart, a foreign policy expert and CNN contributor, said Monday. He added that another Democratic candidate, former Virginia senator and Vietnam war veteran Jim Webb, who was also against the war, could double-team with Sanders to cause trouble for Clinton on the issue.\\n\\nSanders has also been staking out territory to Clinton's left on Syria. The former secretary of state recently distanced herself from Obama's much-criticized policy on the vicious civil war by calling for a no-fly zone to be set up to shield refugees.\\n\\nSanders issued a statement earlier this month pointing out that he opposes such an idea, warning that it could \"get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never ending entanglement in that region.\"\\n\\nThe statement appeared to be a clear appeal to Democrats who share Obama's antipathy toward getting the United States entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict and who are wary of Clinton's more activist instincts on foreign policy.\\n\\nSanders is not alone in seeing Clinton's foreign policy record as a vulnerability. Another Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, also picked up on her Syria position Sunday -- saying on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that a no-fly zone was not advisable and warning that the former secretary of state was \"always quick for the military intervention,\" apparently referring to her previous support for military action in nations such as Iraq and Libya.\\n\\nAnother area where Sanders seems more in tune with the progressive Democratic base is on Wall Street, especially since he has raised most of his money from small donors -- unlike the former secretary of state, who has been relying on big budget fund-raising events with rich contributors. Even with his small-donor focus, Sanders is nearly neck-and-neck in the fund-raising race with Clinton.\\n\\nClinton has made strenuous attempts to connect with what her campaign has called \"regular\" Americans, stressing the need to raise up the middle class to feel the benefits of the economic recovery. But Sanders has said that she hasn't done enough, an argument he may expand upon on the debate stage.\\n\\n\"People will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations with the secretary,\" Sanders said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator also will likely draw an implied contrast with Clinton on two other issues -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact the United States and 11 other nations reached this month and the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry oil from Canada's tar sands across the United States.\\n\\nClinton now says she is a 'no' on both issues, but she took months to get there -- despite fervent opposition to both projects from the left flank of the Democratic Party.\\n\\n\"I am glad that she has reached that conclusion,\" said Sanders in Washington last week when asked about Clinton's opposition to a trade agreement she championed repeatedly as secretary of state. \"This is a conclusion that I reached from day one.\"\\n\\nYet Sanders is not alone in curating the battlefield for the Democratic debate. Clinton, while getting in line with progressive Democratic positions on big issues, has also been preparing to strike key contrasts with Sanders.\\n\\nGuns are one policy issue where Sanders is not completely in sync with the Democratic base, so Clinton is likely to exploit it on Tuesday night.\\n\\nShe has been promising a forthright effort to enact new gun control laws after a string of recent mass shootings. It partly seems to be an attempt to focus attention her rival's record on guns, which recently saw him express his openness to reforms that would hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed with their weapons.\\n\\nClinton has also spent the runup to the debate cementing her links to key voting blocs of the Democratic coalition -- especially in sectors of the party where Sanders is weak. She can point to broad appeal in the party, which could be key to eventually blunting the challenge from Sanders after early-voting contests in the less diverse states of Iowa and New Hampshire where he is strong.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Clinton has met representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement and has even criticized Obama for not going far enough in changing immigration laws.\\n\\n\"Hillary has done a lot of work leading up to this debate that has pretty much gone unnoticed,\" Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN on Monday.\\n\\n\"She's rolled out Latinos for Hillary, she has rolled out Women for Hillary, she has met with the leadership of Black Lives Matter, she has checked a lot of boxes walking into this debate,\" she noted. \"I think she is going to display tomorrow night (Tuesday) her vast support among this coalition.\"\\n\\nThe challenge that Sanders faces reaching out to minority voters, who are a vital part of the Democratic Party voting bloc, was underscored by a new CNN poll Monday finding that only 1% of nonwhite voters in the important early voting state of South Carolina favor him.\\n\\nThat is a showing that Sanders must improve on if he is to come from behind and beat Clinton for the nomination.   \n",

presidential race Tuesday, the Florida senator leaves a large cache of delegates behind. So what happens to them, and the delegates of other former candidates, at the convention in Cleveland?\\n\\nThe short answer is: It varies from state to state, but the Republican Party leaves enough wiggle room that the delegates of former candidates could end up being a factor in July.\\n\\n\"An unbound delegate is worth their weight in gold,\" Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist, told FoxNews.com. \"It's hard to speculate and there's a lot going on right now.\"\\n\\nRubio, in suspending his campaign after his home-state Florida loss, leaves 169 delegates behind. Ben Carson accrued eight delegates before he dropped out of the race, while Jeb Bush picked up four. Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul each picked up one in Iowa.\\n\\nAnd if either Ted Cruz or John Kasich drop out in the weeks ahead -- and Donald Trump still has not clinched the nomination with the necessary 1,237 delegates -- additional zombie delegates could be in play in Cleveland.\\n\\nAnd they could hold sway.\\n\\nThat's because in most states, delegates become \"unbound\" and are free to support other contenders as soon as their candidate withdraws.\\n\\nThey don't necessarily have to gravitate toward the front-runner at a contested convention, or, in the case of Rubio's delegates, the candidate the Florida senator may ultimately choose to endorse.\\n\\nThey would become essentially free agents, prizes to be wooed by the candidates duking it out in Cleveland.\\n\\nHowever some states bind their delegates to the first ballot no matter what.\\n\\nIn Tennessee, delegates are bound for two rounds of voting, while in Iowa, Texas, Virginia, Montana, Nevada, Puerto Rico and Washington, candidates are bound for at least one round of voting whether or not the candidate has withdrawn.\\n\\nIn South Carolina, delegates are bound to the candidate for the first ballot. However, if the winner is not nominated, they are bound to the candidate who finished second or third in the state.\\n\\nThe various state laws mean that while some of the delegates can already peel off to other candidates, many would have to wait until after a first ballot in order to be able to vote for another candidate still in the race.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether front-runner Trump might be able to reach 1,237 delegates before the convention and avoid this drama. He currently has 661; Ted Cruz has 406; and John Kasich has 142.\\n\\nThose, such as Kasich, who are banking on the prospect of a contested convention, where the delegates of ex-candidates and other factors could be in play, see a blueprint in past races dating back decades.\\n\\nSince 1880, there have been eight contested GOP conventions and in five of those, the eventual winner did not go into the convention with a plurality of delegates.\\n\\nIn the 1976 Republican convention, it was the unbound delegates moving toward President Gerald Ford instead of Ronald Reagan that handed Ford the nomination that year. Ford held a slight lead going into the convention, but was shy of an outright majority.\\n\\nIn part by using the power of the White House, with promises of visits and patronage to woo over delegates, Ford won the nomination on the first ballot, by a slim 60 votes.   \n",

But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country.

       "      <td>In Baltimore's call for federal police probe, a new search for answers (+video)</td>\n",
       "      <td>While some Justice Department investigations are adversarial, a new model of collaborative reform is surprising police in some cities, as they find themselves included as part of the solution.\\n\\nSearching for a \"framework ... [to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>while some justice department investigations are adversarial, a new model of collaborative reform is surprising police in some cities, as they find themselves included as part of the solution.\\n\\nsearching for a \"framework ... [to] heal,\" baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake put in a 911 call to the us department of justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the baltimore police department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nher call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of freddie gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nwhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nin fact, following a baltimore sun series on police abuses in the city last year, police commissioner anthony batts approached the justice department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day mr. gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nsome doj investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. but a federal investigation into whether baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in las vegas and philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says sam walker, a criminologist at the university of nebraska at omaha.\\n\\nto be sure, mr. walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that mayor rawlings-blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nbut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nafter las vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the department of justice for help a year later. in 2011, the doj began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nas of 2012, the las vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. the department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in las vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nin march, the justice department reported back on practices of the philadelphia police department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. the doj team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nsurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. the training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the doj report stated. “they did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\naside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the justice department found that philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. in fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“i want to express regrets for all who have been shot in philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" philadelphia mayor michael nutter said in march. \"we're one big city. everyone wants to be safe. citizens want to be safe. police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nthe justice department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in march that documented abuses by the ferguson (mo.) police department that helped fuel protests in the wake of michael’s brown death last august, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nso far, attorney general loretta lynch has not replied to the baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nbut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of gray.\\n\\nsince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\ntrue, institutional change can be difficult. after the baltimore police department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of

       "      <td>Inside the Trump-Bush melodrama: Decades of tension and discomfort</td>\n",
       "      <td>Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“i had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” trump said. “in fact, i remember [jeb bush] saying, ‘it was the most successful fundraiser i’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\ntrump said george h.w. bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nnevertheless, trump’s swipes at the elder bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “the america we deserve.” in it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the american presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nin that same book, trump praised jeb bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . i believe we could get another president from the bushes.”\\n\\ntrump’s unpredictable commentary led most bush insiders to keep their distance. nicholas f. brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the bush circle has rarely overlapped with trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nas for the pot shots at jeb these days, brady said, “he must understand that donald’s way of expressing himself is different. he tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. we can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nformer ambassador mel sembler, a bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at trump tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“you don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” sembler said. “i would never put on a fundraiser — and i put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody i really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘i have never tried to click’\\n\\nin 1999, as then-texas gov. george w. bush was consolidating the republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, trump explored a run of his own in the reform party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of ross perot that many republicans were convinced cost bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\ntrump went on cnn’s “larry king live” and said bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. later that fall, trump made a splashy visit to miami, jeb bush’s adopted home town. rallying cuban americans in little havana, trump knocked george w. bush and then-vice president al gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nin the end, trump did not run. but by george w. bush’s second term in the oval office, trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. in the run-up to bush’s 2004 reelection, trump criticized his management of the iraq war. by 2007, he declared that bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\ntrump said in the post interview that he blames bush for the rise of the islamic state terrorist group, which has seized parts of iraq and neighboring syria.\\n\\n“i was very much opposed to the war in iraq,” he said. “the brother went in and destabilized the entire region. if [jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with iraq, i don’t think you’d have a destabilized middle east right now.”\\n\\nduring jeb bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in south florida, trump shunned him.\\n\\n“i’ve never tried to click,” he said. “if i devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think i’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\ninstead, trump cultivated ties to bush allies in tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in manhattan or south florida.\\n\\nrecounting one outing with former state house speaker will weatherford (r), trump said: “i think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . i shot 72.”\\n\\nweatherford said this week that he did not remember trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“mr. trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “i respect him and his candidacy, but i am a jeb bush supporter like most current and former public officials in florida.”\\n\\ned o’keefe in pensacola, fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.   \n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015.

       "3  Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 donald trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs monday during a day-long tour of washington, casting doubt on the need for the north atlantic treaty organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular u.s. military presence in asia.\\n\\nthe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of the washington post — came on a day when trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to republican elites.\\n\\non monday night, trump delivered a scripted address in front of the american israel public affairs committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the palestinians.\\n\\ntrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the republican party’s nomination. but in the post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the gop’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nduring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, trump advocated a light footprint in the world. in spite of unrest in the middle east and elsewhere, he said, the united states must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“at what point do you say, ‘hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” trump said in the editorial board meeting. “i know the outer world exists, and i’ll be very cognizant of that. but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\ntrump said u.s. involvement in nato may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in washington. “we certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “nato is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting europe with nato, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[a transcript of donald trump’s meeting with the washington post editorial board]\\n\\nthroughout his unlikely campaign, trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. but with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nthis was one of trump’s goals as he addressed aipac’s annual conference in washington. for perhaps the first time in his campaign, trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\non israel, trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the jewish state. his eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of president obama and his first-term secretary of state, hillary clinton, the democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,” trump vowed. he received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous verizon center arena.\\n\\nearlier monday, trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on capitol hill. it was attended by about two dozen republicans, including influential conservatives in congress and prominent figures from gop policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nthose with whom he met directly urged trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. this person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “this was the donald trump who talks with bankers, not the donald trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\ntrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. he staged an afternoon news conference at the historic old post office pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a trump international hotel, a few blocks from the white house on pennsylvania avenue. the candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\ntrump’s visit to washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nat his luncheon meeting, trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. he later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with house speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” trump said of ryan and other gop leaders. “i can only take [ryan] at face value. i understand duplicity. i understand a lot of things. but he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. i spoke with mitch mcconnell, he could not have been nicer. if people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nneither ryan nor mcconnell (r-ky.), the senate majority leader, attended monday’s meeting with trump. it was held at jones day, the law firm of donald f. mcgahn, a trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by sen. jeff sessions (r-ala.), a key trump ally.\\n\\nattendees included heritage foundation president jim de­mint, a former senator from south carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), former house speaker newt gingrich (r-ga.) and former house appropriations committee chairman bob livingston (r-la.). a group of house members who have endorsed trump also attended.\\n\\n“we met with senator sessions and some of the great people in washington,” trump said. “we had a really good meeting. . . . they can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, i think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\ntrump began the day at the post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nfor the first time, trump listed members of a team chaired by sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: keith kellogg, carter page, george papadopoulos, walid phares and joseph e. schmitz. all are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the george w. bush administration.\\n\\ntrump praised george p. shultz, who served as president ronald reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of russia’s aggression in ukraine, said america’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in nato, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” trump said. “they’re not doing anything. and i say: ‘why is it that germany’s not dealing with nato on ukraine? . . . why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with russia?’ ”\\n\\nwhile the obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active u.s. role in supporting ukraine, the u.s. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. european nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between ukrainian forces and russian-backed separatists.\\n\\ntrump sounded a similar note in discussing the u.s. presence in the pacific. he questioned the value of massive military investments in asia and wondered aloud whether the united states still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“south korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” trump said. “we’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nsuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in south korea, where a u.s. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to north korean threats for decades.\\n\\nasked whether the united states benefits from its involvement in

[to] heal,\" baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake put in a 911 call to the us department of justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the baltimore police department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nher call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of freddie gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nwhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nin fact, following a baltimore sun series on police abuses in the city last year, police commissioner anthony batts approached the justice department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day mr. gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nsome doj investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. but a federal investigation into whether baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in las vegas and philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says sam walker, a criminologist at the university of nebraska at omaha.\\n\\nto be sure, mr. walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that mayor rawlings-blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nbut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nafter las vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the department of justice for help a year later. in 2011, the doj began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nas of 2012, the las vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. the department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in las vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nin march, the justice department reported back on practices of the philadelphia police department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. the doj team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nsurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. the training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the doj report stated. “they did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\naside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the justice department found that philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. in fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“i want to express regrets for all who have been shot in philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" philadelphia mayor michael nutter said in march. \"we're one big city. everyone wants to be safe. citizens want to be safe. police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nthe justice department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in march that documented abuses by the ferguson (mo.) police department that helped fuel protests in the wake of michael’s brown death last august, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nso far, attorney general loretta lynch has not replied to the baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nbut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of gray.\\n\\nsince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\ntrue, institutional change can be difficult. after the baltimore police department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the american civil liberties union has alleged. the issue has reared up again in the gray case, since prosecutor marilyn mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nbut so far in philadelphia and las vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. in philadelphia, commissioner charles ramsey sent every officer a link to the las vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"cops are always leery of something,\" mr. ramsey told the baltimore sun. \"we did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"  \n",

on october 27, 2016 subscribe \\narrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” in other words, donald trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nappearing on good morning america thursday morning, the gop nominee readily defended the insulting

recall what hillary clinton said regarding the donald: “a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” \\ndonald trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone

       "3  donald trump spent a day in january 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the trump international golf club in west palm beach, fla. the billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state rep. steve crisafulli, speaker of the florida house, and two other wired florida republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nbut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on trump’s mind: jeb bush.\\n\\n“he was trashing jeb and, quite honestly, i don’t think he’s ever held jeb in high regard,” said crisafulli, a bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former florida governor to trump. “i’ve met with mr. trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about jeb. . . . he’s always had a negative connotation about jeb.”\\n\\ntrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 gop front-runner has directed at bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nthe feud between the leading republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. and considering trump’s dominant status in polls and bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nthe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between trump and the bush family. since the gilded 1980s, when trump and george h.w. bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between trump and the bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nat the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and trump, a hustling new york city deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“the bushes were never trump’s cup of tea,” said roger stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to trump. asked why the bushes often have kept trump at arm’s length, he said: “he’s not from old, wasp money. the trumps didn’t come on the mayflower.”\\n\\n‘he’s not up to snuff’\\n\\ntrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president bill clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nhe lashed out at former president george w. bush over the war in iraq during his tenure. he turned on bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nbut trump reserves particular, personal ire for jeb bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. one trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of trump: “he’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have jeb not be president.”\\n\\nin a 35-minute interview this week with the washington post tracing his history with the bushes, trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. he found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\non jeb bush: “i mean, this guy. i don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\non george h.w. bush: “i really liked the father — really like him as a person. but i hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\non george w. bush: “he didn’t seem smart. i’d watch him in interviews and i’d look at people and ask, ‘do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nand back to jeb: “he’s not up to snuff. . . . jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. he can’t.”\\n\\ntrump was especially accusatory when he talked about jeb bush’s work in investment banking. after leaving the governor’s office in 2007, bush was an adviser to lehman brothers and, later, barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. trump called bush’s role at lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the great recession.\\n\\n“that’s a hillary clinton kind of situation,” trump said, referring to the democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “this is huge. let me ask you: why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at lehman brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nasked whether he thought bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, trump said, “steer it? he can’t steer himself.”\\n\\ntim miller, a bush spokesman, said trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about lehman.\\n\\nresponding to trump’s broader criticisms, miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“while trump was attending new york liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and republican presidents any chance he got, jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” miller said.\\n\\nin florida, bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of trump’s assaults. former governor bob martinez, a bush friend and supporter, asked, “is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” martinez said. “this is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nbush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “there are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said wednesday in pensacola, fla. “they think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. talking is not leadership. doing is leadership.”\\n\\nal cardenas, another bush friend, suggested trump’s motivation is pure politics: “he wants to win this thing, he sees jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-pac money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\ncardenas also surmised that trump had been a non-factor in bush’s mind.\\n\\n“in a thousand conversations i’ve ever had with jeb, i’ve never heard donald trump mentioned once until last year,” cardenas said. “he was just not a part of ‘jeb world’ in any way that i recall.”\\n\\ntrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the bush family patriarch. it was 1988, and he hosted george h.w. bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the plaza hotel, the palatial new york property trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“i remember don king was there,” trump said in the interview. “big don king. . . . he’s shaking bush’s hand and saying, ‘only in america!’ and, you know don king’s voice. it’s like pavarotti, right?”\\n\\ntrump soured on bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. in 1997, trump said, bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, jeb, who was running for florida governor. trump agreed. the event was in his apartment at trump tower.\\n\\nit was not merely a political favor. trump had been trying to persuade florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“i had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” trump said. “in fact, i remember [jeb bush] saying, ‘it was the most successful fundraiser i’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\ntrump said george h.w. bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nnevertheless, trump’s swipes at the elder bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “the america we deserve.” in it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the american presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nin that same book, trump praised jeb bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . i believe we could get another president from the bushes.”\\n\\ntrump’s unpredictable commentary led most bush insiders to keep their distance. nicholas f. brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the bush circle has rarely overlapped with trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nas for the pot shots at jeb these days, brady said, “he must understand that donald’s way of expressing himself is different. he tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. we can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nformer ambassador mel sembler, a bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at trump tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“you don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” sembler said. “i would never put on a fundraiser — and i put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody i really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘i have never tried to click’\\n\\nin 1999, as then-texas gov. george w. bush was consolidating the republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, trump explored a run of his own in the reform party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of ross perot that many republicans were convinced cost bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\ntrump went on cnn’s “larry king live” and said bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. later that fall, trump made a splashy visit to miami, jeb bush’s adopted home town. rallying cuban americans in little havana, trump knocked george w. bush and then-vice president al gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nin the end, trump did not run. but by george w. bush’s second term in the oval office, trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. in the run-up to bush’s 2004 reelection, trump criticized his management of the iraq war. by 2007, he declared that bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\ntrump said in the post interview that he blames bush for the rise of the islamic state terrorist group, which has seized parts of iraq and neighboring syria.\\n\\n“i was very much opposed to the war in iraq,” he said. “the brother went in and destabilized the entire region. if [jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with iraq, i don’t think you’d have a destabilized middle east right now.”\\n\\nduring jeb bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in south florida, trump shunned him.\\n\\n“i’ve never tried to click,” he said. “if i devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think i’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\ninstead, trump cultivated ties to bush allies in tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in manhattan or south florida.\\n\\nrecounting one outing with former state house speaker will weatherford (r), trump said: “i think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . i shot 72.”\\n\\nweatherford said this week that he did not remember trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“mr. trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “i respect him and his candidacy, but i am a jeb bush supporter like most current and former public officials in florida.”\\n\\ned o’keefe in pensacola, fla., contributed to this report.  \n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday during a day-long tour of Washington, casting doubt on the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular U.S. military presence in Asia.\\n\\nThe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of The Washington Post — came on a day when Trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to Republican elites.\\n\\nOn Monday night, Trump delivered a scripted address in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by Israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the Palestinians.\\n\\nTrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the Republican Party’s nomination. But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>While some Justice Department investigations are adversarial, a new model of collaborative reform is surprising police in some cities, as they find themselves included as part of the solution.\\n\\nSearching for a \"framework ... [to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I’ve Insulted Deserved It By Andrew Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media?

       "      <td>Inside the Trump-Bush melodrama: Decades of tension and discomfort</td>\n",
       "      <td>Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.   \n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” \\nDonald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

       "3  Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.   \n",

                        donald trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs monday during a day-long tour of washington, casting doubt on the need for the north atlantic treaty organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular u.s. military presence in asia.\\n\\nthe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of the washington post — came on a day when trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to republican elites.\\n\\non monday night, trump delivered a scripted address in front of the american israel public affairs committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the palestinians.\\n\\ntrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the republican party’s nomination. but in the post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the gop’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nduring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, trump advocated a light footprint in the world. in spite of unrest in the middle east and elsewhere, he said, the united states must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“at what point do you say, ‘hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” trump said in the editorial board meeting. “i know the outer world exists, and i’ll be very cognizant of that. but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\ntrump said u.s. involvement in nato may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in washington. “we certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “nato is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting europe with nato, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[a transcript of donald trump’s meeting with the washington post editorial board]\\n\\nthroughout his unlikely campaign, trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. but with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nthis was one of trump’s goals as he addressed aipac’s annual conference in washington. for perhaps the first time in his campaign, trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\non israel, trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the jewish state. his eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of president obama and his first-term secretary of state, hillary clinton, the democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,” trump vowed. he received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous verizon center arena.\\n\\nearlier monday, trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on capitol hill. it was attended by about two dozen republicans, including influential conservatives in congress and prominent figures from gop policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nthose with whom he met directly urged trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. this person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “this was the donald trump who talks with bankers, not the donald trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\ntrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. he staged an afternoon news conference at the historic old post office pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a trump international hotel, a few blocks from the white house on pennsylvania avenue. the candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\ntrump’s visit to washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nat his luncheon meeting, trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. he later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with house speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” trump said of ryan and other gop leaders. “i can only take [ryan] at face value. i understand duplicity. i understand a lot of things. but he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. i spoke with mitch mcconnell, he could not have been nicer. if people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nneither ryan nor mcconnell (r-ky.), the senate majority leader, attended monday’s meeting with trump. it was held at jones day, the law firm of donald f. mcgahn, a trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by sen. jeff sessions (r-ala.), a key trump ally.\\n\\nattendees included heritage foundation president jim de­mint, a former senator from south carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), former house speaker newt gingrich (r-ga.) and former house appropriations committee chairman bob livingston (r-la.). a group of house members who have endorsed trump also attended.\\n\\n“we met with senator sessions and some of the great people in washington,” trump said. “we had a really good meeting. . . . they can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, i think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\ntrump began the day at the post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nfor the first time, trump listed members of a team chaired by sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: keith kellogg, carter page, george papadopoulos, walid phares and joseph e. schmitz. all are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the george w. bush administration.\\n\\ntrump praised george p. shultz, who served as president ronald reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of russia’s aggression in ukraine, said america’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in nato, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” trump said. “they’re not doing anything. and i say: ‘why is it that germany’s not dealing with nato on ukraine? . . . why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with russia?’ ”\\n\\nwhile the obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active u.s. role in supporting ukraine, the u.s. military has

ukrainian forces and russian-backed separatists.\\n\\ntrump sounded a similar note in discussing the u.s. presence in the pacific. he questioned the value of massive military investments in asia and wondered aloud whether the united states still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“south korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” trump said. “we’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nsuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in south korea, where a u.s. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to north korean threats for decades.\\n\\nasked whether the united states benefits from its involvement in asia, trump replied, “personally, i don’t think so.” he added: “i think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. and we’re a poor country now. we’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\njenna johnson, paul

[to] heal,\" baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake put in a 911 call to the us department of justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the baltimore police department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nher call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of freddie gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nwhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nin fact, following a baltimore sun series on police abuses in the city last year, police commissioner anthony batts approached the justice department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day mr. gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nsome doj investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. but a federal investigation into whether baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in las vegas and philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says sam walker, a criminologist at the university of nebraska at omaha.\\n\\nto be sure, mr. walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that mayor rawlings-blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nbut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nafter las vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the department of justice for help a year later. in 2011, the doj began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nas of 2012, the las vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. the department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in las vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nin march, the justice department reported back on practices of the philadelphia police department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. the doj team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nsurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. the training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the doj report stated. “they did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\naside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the justice department found that philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. in fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“i want to express regrets for all who have been shot in philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" philadelphia mayor michael nutter said in march. \"we're one big city. everyone wants to be safe. citizens want to be safe. police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nthe justice department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in march that documented abuses by the ferguson (mo.) police department that helped fuel protests in the wake of michael’s brown death last august, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nso far, attorney general loretta lynch has not replied to the baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nbut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of gray.\\n\\nsince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\ntrue, institutional change can be difficult. after the baltimore police department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the american civil liberties union has alleged. the issue has reared up again in the gray case, since prosecutor marilyn mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nbut so far in philadelphia and las vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. in philadelphia, commissioner charles ramsey sent every officer a link to the las vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"cops are always leery of something,\" mr. ramsey told the baltimore sun. \"we did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

other words, donald trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nappearing on good morning america thursday morning, the gop nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on twitter: “it’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\ntrump then declared : “i believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, i have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes i’ll use that. and i agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nwhen exactly has trump been careful with what he posts on social media? try never. \\nmelania trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes first lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “what’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\ndoes that mean she’ll take away donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? yeah, good luck with that, melania! \\nearlier this week, the new york times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings trump has made on twitter since he announced he would be running for president in 2015. if you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the times article and recall what hillary clinton said regarding the donald: “a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” \\ndonald trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world. \\nfeatured image via youtube screengrab about andrew bradford \\nandrew bradford is a single father who lives in atlanta. a member of

       "3  donald trump spent a day in january 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the trump international golf club in west palm beach, fla. the billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state rep. steve crisafulli, speaker of the florida house, and two other wired florida republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nbut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on trump’s mind: jeb bush.\\n\\n“he was trashing jeb and, quite honestly, i don’t think he’s ever held jeb in high regard,” said crisafulli, a bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former florida governor to trump. “i’ve met with mr. trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about jeb. . . . he’s always had a negative connotation about jeb.”\\n\\ntrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 gop front-runner has directed at bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nthe feud between the leading republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. and considering trump’s dominant status in polls and bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nthe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between trump and the bush family. since the gilded 1980s, when trump and george h.w. bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between trump and the bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nat the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and trump, a hustling new york city deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“the bushes were never trump’s cup of tea,” said roger stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to trump. asked why the bushes often have kept trump at arm’s length, he said: “he’s not from old, wasp money. the trumps didn’t come on the mayflower.”\\n\\n‘he’s not up to snuff’\\n\\ntrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president bill clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nhe lashed out at former president george w. bush over the war in iraq during his tenure. he turned on bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nbut trump reserves particular, personal ire for jeb bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. one trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of trump: “he’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have jeb not be president.”\\n\\nin a 35-minute interview this week with the washington post tracing his history with the bushes, trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. he found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\non jeb bush: “i mean, this guy. i don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\non george h.w. bush: “i really liked the father — really like him as a person. but i hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\non george w. bush: “he didn’t seem smart. i’d watch him in interviews and i’d look at people and ask, ‘do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nand back to jeb: “he’s not up to snuff. . . . jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. he can’t.”\\n\\ntrump was especially accusatory when he talked about jeb bush’s work in investment banking. after leaving the governor’s office in 2007, bush was an adviser to lehman brothers and, later, barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. trump called bush’s role at lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the great recession.\\n\\n“that’s a hillary clinton kind of situation,” trump said, referring to the democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “this is huge. let me ask you: why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at lehman brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nasked whether he thought bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, trump said, “steer it? he can’t steer himself.”\\n\\ntim miller, a bush spokesman, said trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about lehman.\\n\\nresponding to trump’s broader criticisms, miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“while trump was attending new york liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and republican presidents any chance he got, jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” miller said.\\n\\nin florida, bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of trump’s assaults. former governor bob martinez, a bush friend and supporter, asked, “is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” martinez said. “this is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nbush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “there are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said wednesday in pensacola, fla. “they think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. talking is not leadership. doing is leadership.”\\n\\nal cardenas, another bush friend, suggested trump’s motivation is pure politics: “he wants to win this thing, he sees jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-pac money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\ncardenas also surmised that trump had been a non-factor in bush’s mind.\\n\\n“in a thousand conversations i’ve ever had with jeb, i’ve never heard donald trump mentioned once until last year,” cardenas said. “he was just not a part of ‘jeb world’ in any way that i recall.”\\n\\ntrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the bush family patriarch. it was 1988, and he hosted george h.w. bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the plaza hotel, the palatial new york property trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“i remember don king was there,” trump said in the interview. “big don king. . . . he’s shaking bush’s hand and saying, ‘only in america!’ and, you know don king’s voice. it’s like pavarotti, right?”\\n\\ntrump soured on bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. in 1997, trump said, bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, jeb, who was running for florida governor. trump agreed. the event was in his apartment at trump tower.\\n\\nit was not merely a political favor. trump had been trying to persuade florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“i had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” trump said. “in fact, i remember [jeb bush] saying, ‘it was the most successful fundraiser i’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\ntrump said george h.w. bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nnevertheless, trump’s swipes at the elder bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “the america we deserve.” in it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the american presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nin that same book, trump praised jeb bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . i believe we could get another president from the bushes.”\\n\\ntrump’s unpredictable commentary led most bush insiders to keep their distance. nicholas f. brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the bush circle has rarely overlapped with trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nas for the pot shots at jeb these days, brady said, “he must understand that donald’s way of expressing himself is different. he tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. we can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nformer ambassador mel sembler, a bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at trump tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“you don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” sembler said. “i would never put on a fundraiser — and i put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody i really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘i have never tried to click’\\n\\nin 1999, as then-texas gov. george w. bush was consolidating the republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, trump explored a run of his own in the reform party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of ross perot that many republicans were convinced cost bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\ntrump went on cnn’s “larry king live” and said bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. later that fall, trump made a splashy visit to miami, jeb bush’s adopted home town. rallying cuban americans in little havana, trump knocked george w. bush and then-vice president al gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nin the end, trump did not run. but by george w. bush’s second term in the oval office, trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. in the run-up to bush’s 2004 reelection, trump criticized his management of the iraq war. by 2007, he declared that bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\ntrump said in the post interview that he blames bush for the rise of the islamic state terrorist group, which has seized parts of iraq and neighboring syria.\\n\\n“i was very much opposed to the war in iraq,” he said. “the brother went in and destabilized the entire region. if [jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with iraq, i don’t think you’d have a destabilized middle east right now.”\\n\\nduring jeb bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in south florida, trump shunned him.\\n\\n“i’ve never tried to click,” he said. “if i devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think i’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\ninstead, trump cultivated ties to bush allies in tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in manhattan or south florida.\\n\\nrecounting one outing with former state house speaker will weatherford (r), trump said: “i think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . i shot 72.”\\n\\nweatherford said this week that he did not remember trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“mr. trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “i respect him and his candidacy, but i am a jeb bush supporter like most current and former public officials in florida.”\\n\\ned o’keefe in pensacola, fla., contributed to this report.   \n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday during a day-long tour of Washington, casting doubt on the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular U.S. military presence in Asia.\\n\\nThe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of The Washington Post — came on a day when Trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to Republican elites.\\n\\nOn Monday night, Trump delivered a scripted address in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by Israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the Palestinians.\\n\\nTrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the Republican Party’s nomination. But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.</td>\n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

of style, manner and class between the bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and trump, a hustling new york city deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“the bushes were never trump’s cup of tea,” said roger stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to trump. asked why the bushes often have kept trump at arm’s length, he said: “he’s not from old, wasp money. the trumps didn’t come on the mayflower.”\\n\\n‘he’s not up to snuff’\\n\\ntrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president bill clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nhe lashed out at former president george w. bush over the war in iraq during his tenure. he turned on bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nbut trump reserves particular, personal ire for jeb bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. one trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of trump: “he’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have jeb not be president.”\\n\\nin a 35-minute interview this week with the washington post tracing his history with the bushes, trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. he found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\non jeb bush: “i mean, this guy. i don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\non george h.w. bush: “i really liked the father — really like him as a person. but i hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\non george w. bush: “he didn’t seem smart. i’d watch him in interviews and i’d look at people and ask, ‘do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nand back to jeb: “he’s not up to snuff. . . . jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. he can’t.”\\n\\ntrump was especially accusatory when he talked about jeb bush’s work in investment banking. after leaving the governor’s office in 2007, bush was an adviser to lehman brothers and, later, barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. trump called bush’s role at lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the great recession.\\n\\n“that’s a hillary clinton kind of situation,” trump said, referring to the democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “this is huge. let me ask you: why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at lehman brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nasked whether he thought bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, trump said, “steer it? he can’t steer himself.”\\n\\ntim miller, a bush spokesman, said trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about lehman.\\n\\nresponding to trump’s broader criticisms, miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“while trump was attending new york liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and republican presidents any chance he got, jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” miller said.\\n\\nin florida, bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of trump’s assaults. former governor bob martinez, a bush friend and supporter, asked, “is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” martinez said. “this is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nbush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “there are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said wednesday in pensacola, fla. “they think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. talking is not leadership. doing is leadership.”\\n\\nal cardenas, another bush friend, suggested trump’s motivation is pure politics: “he wants to win this thing, he sees jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-pac money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\ncardenas also surmised that trump had been a non-factor in bush’s mind.\\n\\n“in a thousand conversations i’ve ever had with jeb, i’ve never heard donald trump mentioned once until last year,” cardenas said. “he was just not a part of ‘jeb world’ in any way that i recall.”\\n\\ntrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the bush family patriarch. it was 1988, and he hosted george h.w. bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the plaza hotel, the palatial new york property trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“i remember don king was there,” trump said in the interview. “big don king. . . . he’s shaking bush’s hand and saying, ‘only in america!’ and, you know don king’s voice. it’s like pavarotti, right?”\\n\\ntrump soured on bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. in 1997, trump said, bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, jeb, who was running for florida governor. trump agreed. the event was in his apartment at trump tower.\\n\\nit was not merely a political favor. trump had been trying to persuade florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“i had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” trump said. “in fact, i remember [jeb bush] saying, ‘it was the most successful fundraiser i’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\ntrump said george h.w. bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nnevertheless, trump’s swipes at the elder bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “the america we deserve.” in it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the american presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nin that same book, trump praised jeb bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . i believe we could get another president from the bushes.”\\n\\ntrump’s unpredictable commentary led most bush insiders to keep their distance. nicholas f. brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the bush circle has rarely overlapped with trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nas for the pot shots at jeb these days, brady said, “he must understand that donald’s way of expressing himself is different. he tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. we can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nformer ambassador mel sembler, a bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at trump tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“you don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” sembler said. “i would never put on a fundraiser — and i put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody i really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘i have never tried to click’\\n\\nin 1999, as then-texas gov. george w. bush was consolidating the republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, trump explored a run of his own in the reform party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of ross perot that many republicans were convinced cost bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\ntrump went on cnn’s “larry king live” and said bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. later that fall, trump made a splashy visit to miami, jeb bush’s adopted home town. rallying cuban americans in little havana, trump knocked george w. bush and then-vice president al gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nin the end, trump did not run. but by george w. bush’s second term in the oval office, trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. in the run-up to bush’s 2004 reelection, trump criticized his management of the iraq war. by 2007, he declared that bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\ntrump said in the post interview that he blames bush for the rise of the islamic state terrorist group, which has seized parts of iraq and neighboring syria.\\n\\n“i was very much opposed to the war in iraq,” he said. “the brother went in and destabilized the entire region. if [jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with iraq, i don’t think you’d have a destabilized middle east right now.”\\n\\nduring jeb bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in south florida, trump shunned him.\\n\\n“i’ve never tried to click,” he said. “if i devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think i’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\ninstead, trump cultivated ties to bush allies in tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in manhattan or south florida.\\n\\nrecounting one outing with former state house speaker will weatherford (r), trump said: “i think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . i shot 72.”\\n\\nweatherford said this week that he did not remember trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“mr. trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “i respect him and his candidacy, but i am a jeb bush supporter like most current and former public officials in florida.”\\n\\ned o’keefe in pensacola, fla., contributed to this report.</td>\n",

But in the Post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the GOP’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nDuring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, Trump advocated a light footprint in the world. In spite of unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, he said, the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“At what point do you say, ‘Hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” Trump said in the editorial board meeting. “I know the outer world exists, and I’ll be very cognizant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\nTrump said U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington. “We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board]\\n\\nThroughout his unlikely campaign, Trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. But with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nThis was one of Trump’s goals as he addressed AIPAC’s annual conference in Washington. For perhaps the first time in his campaign, Trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\nOn Israel, Trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the Jewish state. His eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, Trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of President Obama and his first-term secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One,” Trump vowed. He received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous Verizon Center arena.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on Capitol Hill. It was attended by about two dozen Republicans, including influential conservatives in Congress and prominent figures from GOP policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nThose with whom he met directly urged Trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. This person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “This was the Donald Trump who talks with bankers, not the Donald Trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\nTrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. He staged an afternoon news conference at the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\nTrump’s visit to Washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the Republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nAt his luncheon meeting, Trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. He later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“Now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” Trump said of Ryan and other GOP leaders. “I can only take [Ryan] at face value. I understand duplicity. I understand a lot of things. But he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke with Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nNeither Ryan nor McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, attended Monday’s meeting with Trump. It was held at Jones Day, the law firm of Donald F. McGahn, a Trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a key Trump ally.\\n\\nAttendees included Heritage Foundation President Jim De­Mint, a former senator from South Carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.). A group of House members who have endorsed Trump also attended.\\n\\n“We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington,” Trump said. “We had a really good meeting. . . . They can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\nTrump began the day at The Post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nFor the first time, Trump listed members of a team chaired by Sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph E. Schmitz. All are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nTrump praised George P. Shultz, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, said America’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” Trump said. “They’re not doing anything. And I say: ‘Why is it that Germany’s not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? . . . Why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with Russia?’ ”\\n\\nWhile the Obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active U.S. role in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. European nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.\\n\\nTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the U.S. presence in the Pacific. He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“South Korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” Trump said. “We’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nSuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in South Korea, where a U.S. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to North Korean threats for decades.\\n\\nAsked whether the United States benefits from its involvement in Asia, Trump replied, “Personally, I don’t think so.” He added: “I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation.”\\n\\nJenna Johnson, Paul Kane, Missy Ryan and David Weigel contributed to this report.   \n",

[to] heal,\" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nHer call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between Washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nWhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day Mr. Gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nSome DOJ investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says Sam Walker, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\\n\\nTo be sure, Mr. Walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor Rawlings-Blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later. In 2011, the DOJ began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nAs of 2012, the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. The department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. Since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nIn March, the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. The DOJ team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nSurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. The training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“Interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the DOJ report stated. “They did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\nAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. In fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“I want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... Every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March. \"We're one big city. Everyone wants to be safe. Citizens want to be safe. Police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the Obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. Some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson (Mo.) Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michael’s Brown death last August, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nSo far, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nBut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of Gray.\\n\\nSince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\nTrue, institutional change can be difficult. After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged. The issue has reared up again in the Gray case, since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. In Philadelphia, Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"Cops are always leery of something,\" Mr. Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun. \"We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nArrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” \\nTrump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” \\nDoes that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015.

       "3  Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep. Steve Crisafulli, speaker of the Florida House, and two other wired Florida Republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on Trump’s mind: Jeb Bush.\\n\\n“He was trashing Jeb and, quite honestly, I don’t think he’s ever held Jeb in high regard,” said Crisafulli, a Bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump. “I’ve met with Mr. Trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about Jeb. . . . He’s always had a negative connotation about Jeb.”\\n\\nTrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP front-runner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nThe feud between the leading Republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. And considering Trump’s dominant status in polls and Bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family. Since the gilded 1980s, when Trump and George H.W. Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nAt the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“The Bushes were never Trump’s cup of tea,” said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump. Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arm’s length, he said: “He’s not from old, WASP money. The Trumps didn’t come on the Mayflower.”\\n\\n‘He’s not up to snuff’\\n\\nTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nHe lashed out at former president George W. Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure. He turned on Bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nBut Trump reserves particular, personal ire for Jeb Bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. One Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of Trump: “He’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have Jeb not be president.”\\n\\nIn a 35-minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes, Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. He found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\nOn Jeb Bush: “I mean, this guy. I don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\nOn George H.W. Bush: “I really liked the father — really like him as a person. But I hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\nOn George W. Bush: “He didn’t seem smart. I’d watch him in interviews and I’d look at people and ask, ‘Do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nAnd back to Jeb: “He’s not up to snuff. . . . Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. He can’t.”\\n\\nTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bush’s work in investment banking. After leaving the governor’s office in 2007, Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and, later, Barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. Trump called Bush’s role at Lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great Recession.\\n\\n“That’s a Hillary Clinton kind of situation,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “This is huge. Let me ask you: Why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at Lehman Brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, Trump said, “Steer it? He can’t steer himself.”\\n\\nTim Miller, a Bush spokesman, said Trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about Lehman.\\n\\nResponding to Trump’s broader criticisms, Miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to Democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“While Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got, Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” Miller said.\\n\\nIn Florida, Bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trump’s assaults. Former governor Bob Martinez, a Bush friend and supporter, asked, “Is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“Some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” Martinez said. “This is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nBush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with Trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “There are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said Wednesday in Pensacola, Fla. “They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership.”\\n\\nAl Cardenas, another Bush friend, suggested Trump’s motivation is pure politics: “He wants to win this thing, he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-PAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\nCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a non-factor in Bush’s mind.\\n\\n“In a thousand conversations I’ve ever had with Jeb, I’ve never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year,” Cardenas said. “He was just not a part of ‘Jeb world’ in any way that I recall.”\\n\\nTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch. It was 1988, and he hosted George H.W. Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, the palatial New York property Trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“I remember Don King was there,” Trump said in the interview. “Big Don King. . . . He’s shaking Bush’s hand and saying, ‘Only in America!’ And, you know Don King’s voice. It’s like Pavarotti, right?”\\n\\nTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. In 1997, Trump said, Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, Jeb, who was running for Florida governor. Trump agreed. The event was in his apartment at Trump Tower.\\n\\nIt was not merely a political favor. Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“I had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” Trump said. “In fact, I remember [Jeb Bush] saying, ‘It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\nTrump said George H.W. Bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump’s swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nIn that same book, Trump praised Jeb Bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . I believe we could get another president from the Bushes.”\\n\\nTrump’s unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance. Nicholas F. Brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days, Brady said, “He must understand that Donald’s way of expressing himself is different. He tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. We can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nFormer ambassador Mel Sembler, a Bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“You don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” Sembler said. “I would never put on a fundraiser — and I put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘I have never tried to click’\\n\\nIn 1999, as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\nTrump went on CNN’s “Larry King Live” and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. Later that fall, Trump made a splashy visit to Miami, Jeb Bush’s adopted home town. Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana, Trump knocked George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nIn the end, Trump did not run. But by George W. Bush’s second term in the Oval Office, Trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. In the run-up to Bush’s 2004 reelection, Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war. By 2007, he declared that Bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\nTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.\\n\\n“I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq,” he said. “The brother went in and destabilized the entire region. If [Jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with Iraq, I don’t think you’d have a destabilized Middle East right now.”\\n\\nDuring Jeb Bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in South Florida, Trump shunned him.\\n\\n“I’ve never tried to click,” he said. “If I devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think I’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\nInstead, Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South Florida.\\n\\nRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford (R), Trump said: “I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . I shot 72.”\\n\\nWeatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“Mr. Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” Weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “I respect him and his candidacy, but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in Florida.”\\n\\nEd O’Keefe in Pensacola, Fla., contributed to this report.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 donald trump endorsed an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs monday during a day-long tour of washington, casting doubt on the need for the north atlantic treaty organization and expressing skepticism about a muscular u.s. military presence in asia.\\n\\nthe foreign policy positions — outlined in a meeting with the editorial board of the washington post — came on a day when trump set aside the guerrilla tactics and showman bravado that have powered his campaign to appear as a would-be presidential nominee, explaining his policies, accepting counsel and building bridges to republican elites.\\n\\non monday night, trump delivered a scripted address in front of the american israel public affairs committee, prompting ovations with pledges to stand by israel and take a hard line on peace talks with the palestinians.\\n\\ntrump’s whirlwind day of appearances around the nation’s capital was intended in part to head off an establishment push to deny him the republican party’s nomination. but in the post meeting, the billionaire mogul also made clear that he would not be beholden to the gop’s long-held orthodoxies.\\n\\nduring the hour-long discussion, during which he revealed five of his foreign policy advisers, trump advocated a light footprint in the world. in spite of unrest in the middle east and elsewhere, he said, the united states must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.\\n\\n“at what point do you say, ‘hey, we have to take care of ourselves?’ ” trump said in the editorial board meeting. “i know the outer world exists, and i’ll be very cognizant of that. but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.”\\n\\ntrump said u.s. involvement in nato may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in washington. “we certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said, adding later, “nato is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting europe with nato, but we’re spending a lot of money.”\\n\\n[a transcript of donald trump’s meeting with the washington post editorial board]\\n\\nthroughout his unlikely campaign, trump’s unpredictable, incendiary persona has been his rocket fuel. but with the nomination now within his reach, he is trying at times to round out his sharp edges to convince his party’s leaders — not to mention general-election voters — that he has the temperament and knowledge to be president.\\n\\nthis was one of trump’s goals as he addressed aipac’s annual conference in washington. for perhaps the first time in his campaign, trump read from a prepared text on teleprompters — a device he has colorfully mocked other politicians for using.\\n\\non israel, trump mostly hewed to the party line, giving a full-throated defense of the nation and its interests and arguing that no candidate is a more forceful champion of the jewish state. his eyes pinging back and forth between the teleprompter screens, trump embellished his prepared text only to deliver a few criticisms of president obama and his first-term secretary of state, hillary clinton, the democratic presidential front-runner.\\n\\n“when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,” trump vowed. he received enthusiastic applause from the crowd of thousands, and the much-rumored walkouts during his speech were either called off or went unnoticed in the cavernous verizon center arena.\\n\\nearlier monday, trump sought to cultivate ties with his party’s establishment at a private luncheon he hosted on capitol hill. it was attended by about two dozen republicans, including influential conservatives in congress and prominent figures from gop policy and lobbying circles.\\n\\nthose with whom he met directly urged trump to “be more presidential,” according to one attendee. this person, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate details of the closed session, described it as “a very serious conversation,” adding: “this was the donald trump who talks with bankers, not the donald trump who is on the stage.”\\n\\ntrump also sought to showcase his business acumen and dealmaking prowess. he staged an afternoon news conference at the historic old post office pavilion, which his real estate company is turning into a trump international hotel, a few blocks from the white house on pennsylvania avenue. the candidate, flanked by employees wearing hard hats, led journalists on a tour of the construction zone.\\n\\ntrump’s visit to washington comes amid an intensified effort by some in the republican establishment, including 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney, to deny him the nomination by forcing a contested convention at which the party could rally around an alternative.\\n\\nat his luncheon meeting, trump warned party leaders against using parliamentary maneuvers to block his nomination. he later told reporters that he had a productive conversation recently with house speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.) and that he has “many millions of people behind me.”\\n\\n“now, they can play games, and they can play cute,” trump said of ryan and other gop leaders. “i can only take [ryan] at face value. i understand duplicity. i understand a lot of things. but he called me last week, he could not have been nicer. i spoke with mitch mcconnell, he could not have been nicer. if people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement.”\\n\\nneither ryan nor mcconnell (r-ky.), the senate majority leader, attended monday’s meeting with trump. it was held at jones day, the law firm of donald f. mcgahn, a trump campaign attorney, and was convened in part by sen. jeff sessions (r-ala.), a key trump ally.\\n\\nattendees included heritage foundation president jim de­mint, a former senator from south carolina and a conservative movement leader, as well as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), former house speaker newt gingrich (r-ga.) and former house appropriations committee chairman bob livingston (r-la.). a group of house members who have endorsed trump also attended.\\n\\n“we met with senator sessions and some of the great people in washington,” trump said. “we had a really good meeting. . . . they can’t believe how far we’ve come because, you know, i think a lot of people maybe wouldn’t have predicted that.”\\n\\ntrump began the day at the post, where his on-the-record meeting with the editorial board covered media libel laws, violence at his rallies and climate change, as well as foreign policy.\\n\\nfor the first time, trump listed members of a team chaired by sessions that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies: keith kellogg, carter page, george papadopoulos, walid phares and joseph e. schmitz. all are relatively little known in foreign policy circles, and several have ties to the george w. bush administration.\\n\\ntrump praised george p. shultz, who served as president ronald reagan’s secretary of state, as a model diplomat and, on the subject of russia’s aggression in ukraine, said america’s allies are “not doing anything.”\\n\\n“ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in nato, and yet we’re doing all of the lifting,” trump said. “they’re not doing anything. and i say: ‘why is it that germany’s not dealing with nato on ukraine? . . . why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially, the third world war with russia?’ ”\\n\\nwhile the obama administration has faced pressure from congressional critics who have advocated for a more active u.s. role in supporting ukraine, the u.s. military has limited its assistance to nonlethal equipment such as vehicles and night-vision gear. european nations have taken the lead in crafting a fragile cease-fire designed to decrease hostility between ukrainian forces and russian-backed separatists.\\n\\ntrump sounded a similar note in discussing the u.s. presence in the pacific. he questioned the value of massive military investments in asia and wondered aloud whether the united states still is capable of being an effective peacekeeping force there.\\n\\n“south korea is very rich, great industrial country, and yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do,” trump said. “we’re constantly sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games — we’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.”\\n\\nsuch talk is likely to trigger anxiety in south korea, where a u.s. force of 28,000 has provided a strong deterrent to north korean threats for decades.\\n\\nasked whether the united states benefits from its involvement in

[to] heal,\" baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake put in a 911 call to the us department of justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the baltimore police department’s beat cop tactics.\\n\\nher call, not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of freddie gray, is part of a broader trend of \"collaborative reform\" between washington and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nwhat's striking about such investigations is that they don't just slam the police, but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens, as well as show that they are part of the solution.\\n\\nin fact, following a baltimore sun series on police abuses in the city last year, police commissioner anthony batts approached the justice department to conduct a collaborative review, which had been under way the day mr. gray died while in police custody.\\n\\nsome doj investigations are adversarial, as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors. but a federal investigation into whether baltimore cops routinely violate people’s civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in las vegas and philadelphia, where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that they’re doing nothing wrong, says sam walker, a criminologist at the university of nebraska at omaha.\\n\\nto be sure, mr. walker says, it’s “too early to tell” whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that mayor rawlings-blake is hoping to find in the aftermath of gray’s death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riots.\\n\\nbut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect, dignity, and sanctity of life.\\n\\nafter las vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010, the city began its own reforms and asked the department of justice for help a year later. in 2011, the doj began the new collaboration program, delving deep into practices, training procedures, and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the people.\\n\\nas of 2012, the las vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms, including rewriting its use-of-deadly-force policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the “sanctity of human life” as they make critical split-second decisions. the department added so-called reality-based training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged, drunk, or mentally ill citizens. since then, the number of officer-involved shootings in las vegas has stayed below historical averages, year to year.\\n\\nin march, the justice department reported back on practices of the philadelphia police department, which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week, many of them unarmed. the doj team, which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors, released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and training.\\n\\nsurprisingly to some, many complaints came from officers themselves. among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects. the training needed to be less staged and more reality-based, officers said, including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tactics.\\n\\n“interview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter,” the doj report stated. “they did not believe that [training] sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounter.”\\n\\naside from giving leaders hard facts to work with, such reports can also help defend police officers. even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop, the justice department found that philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping. in fact, unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by philadelphia police than unarmed black males.\\n\\n“i want to express regrets for all who have been shot in philadelphia, civilians or police officers.... every life is precious in this city and this country, so we need to maintain this level of focus,\" philadelphia mayor michael nutter said in march. \"we're one big city. everyone wants to be safe. citizens want to be safe. police officers want to be safe.\"\\n\\nthe justice department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000, stepping up the efforts in the obama era, with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone. some of those investigations have been scathing, including a report in march that documented abuses by the ferguson (mo.) police department that helped fuel protests in the wake of michael’s brown death last august, at the hands of a police officer.\\n\\nso far, attorney general loretta lynch has not replied to the baltimore mayor’s request for a separate civil rights abuse probe.\\n\\nbut the request makes clear that the city’s police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of gray.\\n\\nsince 2011, the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly $6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers, only to have trumped-up charges later dropped by a judge.\\n\\ntrue, institutional change can be difficult. after the baltimore police department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training, the department dragged its feet, the american civil liberties union has alleged. the issue has reared up again in the gray case, since prosecutor marilyn mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested gray for carrying a legal knife.\\n\\nbut so far in philadelphia and las vegas, one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution, and that the collaboration isn't about outsiders second-guessing their actions. in philadelphia, commissioner charles ramsey sent every officer a link to the las vegas report, so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actions.\\n\\n\"cops are always leery of something,\" mr. ramsey told the baltimore sun. \"we did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears.\"   \n",

on october 27, 2016 subscribe \\narrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” in other words, donald trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \\nappearing on good morning america thursday morning, the gop nominee readily defended the insulting

       "3  donald trump spent a day in january 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the trump international golf club in west palm beach, fla. the billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state rep. steve crisafulli, speaker of the florida house, and two other wired florida republicans, plugging his properties as potential sites for casinos.\\n\\nbut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens, something else was on trump’s mind: jeb bush.\\n\\n“he was trashing jeb and, quite honestly, i don’t think he’s ever held jeb in high regard,” said crisafulli, a bush supporter who said he was “uncomfortable” with the conversation and defended the former florida governor to trump. “i’ve met with mr. trump on several occasions, and he’s constantly had things to say about jeb. . . . he’s always had a negative connotation about jeb.”\\n\\ntrump’s jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 gop front-runner has directed at bush on the campaign trail this summer.\\n\\nthe feud between the leading republicans, which has escalated in recent days, is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race. and considering trump’s dominant status in polls and bush’s fundraising ability, the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nomination.\\n\\nthe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between trump and the bush family. since the gilded 1980s, when trump and george h.w. bush rose as forces in their respective spheres, the relationship between trump and the bushes has been a melodrama — veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insults.\\n\\nat the core, there are clashes of style, manner and class between the bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and trump, a hustling new york city deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire.\\n\\n“the bushes were never trump’s cup of tea,” said roger stone, a longtime confidant and former adviser to trump. asked why the bushes often have kept trump at arm’s length, he said: “he’s not from old, wasp money. the trumps didn’t come on the mayflower.”\\n\\n‘he’s not up to snuff’\\n\\ntrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the bushes is rooted in pedigree, although he is open about his animosity toward them; he characterizes his relationship with former president bill clinton, for instance, as far closer.\\n\\nhe lashed out at former president george w. bush over the war in iraq during his tenure. he turned on bush’s father when he raised taxes during his term as president, despite pledging not to do so.\\n\\nbut trump reserves particular, personal ire for jeb bush, whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl. one trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly, said of trump: “he’s very smart, he’s driven and he has two goals: one, to be elected president, and two, to have jeb not be president.”\\n\\nin a 35-minute interview this week with the washington post tracing his history with the bushes, trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn. he found 33 ways to skewer the family — about one put-down per minute.\\n\\non jeb bush: “i mean, this guy. i don’t think he has a clue.”\\n\\non george h.w. bush: “i really liked the father — really like him as a person. but i hated his ‘read my lips, no more taxes,’ and then he raised taxes monstrously.”\\n\\non george w. bush: “he didn’t seem smart. i’d watch him in interviews and i’d look at people and ask, ‘do you think he understands the question?’ ”\\n\\nand back to jeb: “he’s not up to snuff. . . . jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land. he can’t.”\\n\\ntrump was especially accusatory when he talked about jeb bush’s work in investment banking. after leaving the governor’s office in 2007, bush was an adviser to lehman brothers and, later, barclays, making between $1.3 million and $2 million a year. trump called bush’s role at lehman a “no-show job” and suggested it was a reward for helping direct florida state funds to the firm, whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the great recession.\\n\\n“that’s a hillary clinton kind of situation,” trump said, referring to the democratic front-\\n\\nrunner. “this is huge. let me ask you: why would you pay a man $1.3 million a year for a no-show job at lehman brothers — which, when it failed, almost took the world with it?”\\n\\nasked whether he thought bush was ready to steer the nation’s economy, trump said, “steer it? he can’t steer himself.”\\n\\ntim miller, a bush spokesman, said trump “is trafficking in false conspiracy theories” about lehman.\\n\\nresponding to trump’s broader criticisms, miller highlighted the developer’s past ties to democrats and liberal causes.\\n\\n“while trump was attending new york liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and republican presidents any chance he got, jeb was the most conservative governor in the country, cutting taxes, reining in the size of government and protecting life,” miller said.\\n\\nin florida, bush’s associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of trump’s assaults. former governor bob martinez, a bush friend and supporter, asked, “is this the way he acts when he’s negotiating with somebody?”\\n\\n“some find it entertaining, some find it odd,” martinez said. “this is not the normal fare you get, certainly.”\\n\\nbush has begun firing back on the stump, though not with trump’s vigor and mostly without naming his opponent. “there are some people running, they’re really talented about filling space — about saying big things,” he said wednesday in pensacola, fla. “they think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership. talking is not leadership. doing is leadership.”\\n\\nal cardenas, another bush friend, suggested trump’s motivation is pure politics: “he wants to win this thing, he sees jeb as the big gorilla with the big super-pac money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretch.”\\n\\ncardenas also surmised that trump had been a non-factor in bush’s mind.\\n\\n“in a thousand conversations i’ve ever had with jeb, i’ve never heard donald trump mentioned once until last year,” cardenas said. “he was just not a part of ‘jeb world’ in any way that i recall.”\\n\\ntrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the bush family patriarch. it was 1988, and he hosted george h.w. bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the plaza hotel, the palatial new york property trump owned at the time.\\n\\n“i remember don king was there,” trump said in the interview. “big don king. . . . he’s shaking bush’s hand and saying, ‘only in america!’ and, you know don king’s voice. it’s like pavarotti, right?”\\n\\ntrump soured on bush when he increased taxes, but they eventually made amends. in 1997, trump said, bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son, jeb, who was running for florida governor. trump agreed. the event was in his apartment at trump tower.\\n\\nit was not merely a political favor. trump had been trying to persuade florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal land.\\n\\n“i had a fundraiser and raised about $1 million, which in those days was a lot of money,” trump said. “in fact, i remember [jeb bush] saying, ‘it was the most successful fundraiser i’ve ever had.’ ”\\n\\ntrump said george h.w. bush wrote him “a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his son.”\\n\\nnevertheless, trump’s swipes at the elder bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book, “the america we deserve.” in it, he said the 41st president “failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the american presidency and simply lost touch.”\\n\\nin that same book, trump praised jeb bush as a “good man” who is “exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future. . . . i believe we could get another president from the bushes.”\\n\\ntrump’s unpredictable commentary led most bush insiders to keep their distance. nicholas f. brady, a family intimate and former treasury secretary, said in an interview that the bush circle has rarely overlapped with trump, politically and socially.\\n\\nas for the pot shots at jeb these days, brady said, “he must understand that donald’s way of expressing himself is different. he tends to short-hop problems and that’s his style. we can’t do much about that.”\\n\\nformer ambassador mel sembler, a bush family friend and fundraiser, said he attended the 1997 event at trump tower and suggested that the current animus must be “newfound.”\\n\\n“you don’t have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home,” sembler said. “i would never put on a fundraiser — and i put on an awful lot of them — unless it was somebody i really felt like would be a great political leader.”\\n\\n‘i have never tried to click’\\n\\nin 1999, as then-texas gov. george w. bush was consolidating the republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy, trump explored a run of his own in the reform party, which grew out of the 1992 independent run of ross perot that many republicans were convinced cost bush’s father his reelection.\\n\\ntrump went on cnn’s “larry king live” and said bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol. later that fall, trump made a splashy visit to miami, jeb bush’s adopted home town. rallying cuban americans in little havana, trump knocked george w. bush and then-vice president al gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were, as he put it, “anointed.”\\n\\nin the end, trump did not run. but by george w. bush’s second term in the oval office, trump had become a thorn in the president’s side. in the run-up to bush’s 2004 reelection, trump criticized his management of the iraq war. by 2007, he declared that bush was “a horrible president — possibly the worst in the history of this country.”\\n\\ntrump said in the post interview that he blames bush for the rise of the islamic state terrorist group, which has seized parts of iraq and neighboring syria.\\n\\n“i was very much opposed to the war in iraq,” he said. “the brother went in and destabilized the entire region. if [jeb’s] brother didn’t do that with iraq, i don’t think you’d have a destabilized middle east right now.”\\n\\nduring jeb bush’s two terms as governor, even as his business interests expanded in south florida, trump shunned him.\\n\\n“i’ve never tried to click,” he said. “if i devoted time to being friendly with them, don’t you think i’d be friendly with them?”\\n\\ninstead, trump cultivated ties to bush allies in tallahassee, inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in manhattan or south florida.\\n\\nrecounting one outing with former state house speaker will weatherford (r), trump said: “i think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else, if you want to know the truth. . . . i shot 72.”\\n\\nweatherford said this week that he did not remember trump shooting 72.\\n\\n“mr. trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities,” weatherford wrote in an e-mail. “i respect him and his candidacy, but i am a jeb bush supporter like most current and former public officials in florida.”\\n\\ned o’keefe in pensacola, fla., contributed to this report.   \n",
